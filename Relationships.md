# Relationships

## People need to live a happy life 
- Live an independent happy life. If you are happy by yourself, you are attractive to others and the relationship is the cherry on the cake. 
You should never be depending on a relationship for happiness. Then, you can bring the partner in to share the hapiness. Because you're independent and confident and completely happy and at peace with yourself, there will be others who want to share their life with me. You cannot expect someone to love you if you don't love yourself. 
- If this is not in place, you will end up needy, controlling and insecure. This comes from a fear of losing her. Realise that being a confident spouse is the thing that reduces risk of losing her.
- Why would someone be excited to spend their life with you if you are selfish, don’t really have any inspiring hobbies and don’t show that you care that much? Really consider what you have to offer someone else before you can expect someone else to join you on the journey. Esssentially, would she want a kid that has a lot of your characteristics? 
- Once you are independent, confident etc. you also automatically place less weight on a relationship such that when things blow up you don't drown
- In a good relationship, all windows and doors are open - allowing people to move away. But even though there is no trap, you will both stay 
- Don't expect your SO to be the sole source of your happiness and contentment in life. They WILL fail you, and when they do, it will destroy the facade of an identity you've built for yourself.
- "Well, you know the expression, 'Happy wife, happy life?' It's bullshit. They've got it backwards. There's a reason that woman agreed to go out with you, a reason she fell in love with you, and a reason she decided to marry you. And that's you. The moment you give up your hobbies, passions, and interests, the instant you put your happiness aside to please her, you've stopped being the man she fell in love with. And if you're unhappy, how the hell are you going to show her anything else? 'Happy life, happy wife,' my friend."

## What is a relationship?
- Two people who love each other, are intimate (sex, hugging, holding hands), are best friends, are excited to share things with, who are comfortable in each other's presence and who are working towards building a future together. Ideally there is also some form of spark / passion between you. 
- A good relationship is based on trust, honesty, communication, belief in each other and support. 
  - Bond on an emotional level where you deeply understand hopes, dreams, desires, fears, insecurities, experiences, memories and you can support in achieving happiness 
  - It’s about making one another better and having fun in the process 
- You need to feel like excited and good around the idea of spending the rest of your life with the person and each time you wake up you need to feel about the two of you. 
- Someone who supports you, who you support, who makes you laugh. 
- With the man I'm with (since more than 4 years), it's the contrary. He makes every plan seems more exciting when he's part of it. He makes me grow, dream, laugh. I feel more powerful and full of life with him, we dream together, we learn together. This doesn't mean we do everyting together, far from it, we're very independant. But I'm always excited to see him, to spend time with him. And I feel more powerful as an individual, which is gold.

## Relationships can end 
- Every relationship is voluntary / a choice. Two people decide and choose daily to love one another - this also means that they can decide to no longer love one another at any point in time
- Everyone's life is short and everyone needs to make the most of their own lives. If that means that someone wants to leave the relationship with you, because that would increase their happiness, don't be a blocker on that. Let them go and have their happiness. Do whatever is best for both of you. You care for one another and sometimes the best thing to do is letting go of someone. Ultimately it’s her life, and if she needs to do this to live her best life, that’s what you’ve gotta let her do. Be mature about this. 
- You need to accept that every relationship can end because of various reasons. One might die, one might want to move abroad, one might want to focus on work or go back to university, people may just want to experience life completely first. It's not in your control which is why your independent happiness will always be the most important to sort out; old people are often alone in their later years as their partner has changed   

## Breaks
- Sometimes people want space and a break. You just have to let her know that you still care, but that you know she needs space, and that's what you're trying to give her. 
- Realize that healthy relationships don't often need a break - you just work things out together. So even if there is a break, make sure there is regular communication otherwise there is a bomb just waiting to explode. Also, the break should last 2 weeks max, otherwise you just drift further apart and get used to life without each other. 
- During breaks: 
  - Reflect on the relationship - your feelings, what you want and and any things you'd like to do differently for the relationship. Also, take time to reflect on the feelings she communicated with you. With this break, remind yourself what you and your partner have, what he or she brings to your life, and how much he or she means to you. Remind yourself of all the reasons why you love her
  - Meet friends and family
  - Pick up hobbies you haven't pursued for a while  
  - Allow yourself to feel lonely and get back used to what that feels like
  - Don't think about the possible outcomes as those are outside of your control
  - Don't play a victim role - she can do whatever she wants to do whenever she wants. Playing a victim won't help anything or anyone
  - To a certain extend, a break is a stress test within the relationship: can you work it out or is it not worth it for either of you? 

## Breakups
- Initially, grief and reflect hard on the relationship and take time to understand what you miss. The next relationship will benefit from all the learning from this phase. Each breakup gives you more experience, more reflection, a better understanding of yourself and of what you want out of life
- Realise its just not meant to be: 
  - A one sided relationship where you're the main one loving won't sustain and would only bring me unhappiness over time
  - We both deserve a relationship where two people love one another completely, who are willing to put in the effort because we both find the relationship worthwhile.
  - If someone doesn't see a future with me or doesn't want to be with me, they are not the one - period 
  - Realise that they might see something that I don't see as I'm too close to the relationship, too depending/needy. Over time, you might come to the same conclusions. 
- Realise that everything is quite random
  - The chance of two people meeting and being good enough for each other during a lifetime is quite small 
  - We grief a relationship that also could have never happened if we hadn't met or if the circumstances would have been different
- See the positive - become the best version of yourself. Realize that single time might be the most precious time in our life as we get to do exactly what we want to do. Learn, experience and go wild. We mostly only change when we're out of our comfort zone so this is a great opportunity to change. 
  - Get completely into something: work out, boxing etc. 
  - Meet friends and family 
  - Life is too short not to enjoy. Breakups are part of life and shouldn't the quality of life too much. Smile and put one foot in front of the other. Just keep going. A relationship is only one part of life. There are many other parts that need to be good such that when the relationship breaks, you should have your backup. 
- Think about the future with curiosity - what else does life have in store for me? What makes life interesting is that things happen and we deal with them. 
- Be grateful: 
  - You don’t forget people that were close to you and you won’t replace them. They’ll always have a place in your heart
  - You're still healthy, have friends and family you can rely on for support and that you're responsible for making an amazing life yourself. 
  - Of what you had and cherish the memories. They're part of your book now. This is the end of a chapter. The new chapters will be exciting as new things will happen and new people will be met. If the last chapter would have continued for much longer, the book might not have been worth reading. 
  - Be happy it happened now and now another 10 years down the line with an entirely different living situation
- Other potential tips 
  - If it helps, consider your ex has passed away. That could also be an outcome and you'd now also be left alone. However, your frame of mind would be different. 
  - The perfect partner would never have left you. Don't think she was perfect 
  - Remember that sometimes the issue is with the person. No matter the relationship he or she is in, it might just never really work out by default. 
  - Realise that it'll feel horrific in the beginning but if we put in the right steps, things will get better over time
  - It will result in dreaming about the other person
- Process: 
  - When someone is trying to break up with me, be a strong person. Showing desparation and crying will make them sympathise and perhaps they can't handle it, meaning they'd stay in the relationship. It also means they would stop being honest with me out of fear of hurting my feelings.  
  - The reasons for breaking up that something tells you could be different from the actual reasons. They tell themselves a convenient truth as well - its all based on feelings and emotions and these change frequently for everybody 
  - No contact is key, don't reach out and don't be a creep. If they want to reach out, they will. But that's not your priority and thinking about this makes nothing better
  - A good way to get closure is to just be honest. I love you and I care for you. If there are things that I need to grow in for us to be happy together, I will give it my all. If you don’t feel the same or you don’t allow me to do this, that’s fine but at least I tried
- Dumper and dumpee experience: 
  - Dumper would also have wanted this to work out. They will doubt their decisions over time whereas in the beginning they may be relieved as they did part of their grieving before they broke up. They might realise the grass isn't always greener on the other side 
  - Dumper is going through hell initially but they'll work their ass off to get better coming out stronger 
- When feeling down, be optimistic about the future and more than anything else, remind yourself of the negative parts of the relationship. I am now scared of the future and feel like I want things back to what it was before. 
- The long and short of it is that I need to work on myself, stop contact and obsessing over her. Move on by accepting and flow like water. Build the life you want.  Be optimistic that in the future, when I am ready I will meet someone I can connect with again. 
- To avoid the worry of an ex finding someone: 
  - Don't follow/communicate with them 
  - The only thing that matters is what I do. Do I want a relationship? Then focus on that. What others do is not relevant. 
- Single time is the best time to make sure you get the experiences you want. If you settle already, you’re actually stuck for life and might not gain the experience you want to have had

## Relationships take work & communication is key
- Being in a good relationship takes effort because you don't want to become complacent and take things for granted. Both people should give it 100%. That causes the other person to lose interest in you because you're no longer a challenge and you probably no longer really contribute to the other person's happiness. It also means that all of a sudden you'll be afraid of losing her as she's all you have in your life.  
- Passion is important, especially for the beginning of a relationship, but it's dedication and commitment that carry a relationship through the years.
- Once you make a decision to be with someone, it's family. It's not going to be always great but you stick to your guns. Don't run away when things are getting hard. There will be days when you can't each other but other days when you love each other like never before. 
- The thing that keeps a relationship going is honest communication 
  - Share specifically how you feel about the relationship and be honest
  - Talk about the future more often and make sure you’re aligned on expectations at all times
  - Speak about our wants and expectations more clearly
  - Apologize sincerely where required and more importantly, show that you change 
  - Really listen to concerns - especially when the same things come up frequently (e.g. cleaning)
  - Take her concerns and action on them but not because she wants you to. If you disagree, mention it and say find a compromise that works for both. Be a bit of a challenge and not just some people pleaser that is easy to walk over. Similarly, don't pressure someone into doing things your way. 
  - When women are venting about their problems they just want you to listen. They don't want advice on how to fix the situation.
  - Set aside time to work on the relationship:
    - What we like / What we don’t like What we’d like to see more of 
    - How are things going / where are we heading / is that the right direction? 
- It's easy to not communicate and let feelings and annoyances build inside of you - eventually this will backfire and blow up however. You need to have these conversations because you value your life and want the best of it. And it you're not happy, ultimately she won't be happy either - you can only live with things so long. If you don't communicate it could also be because you no longer care enough which is also not a good place to be in. 
- Understanding the individual. Figure out what someone else really values in a relationship – this is similar to the love languages. What we value is not what others value.   
- Clarifying expectations and stick to them 
- Confronting someone is a means of showing that you care.  
- We need to realize that life is not either /or. It’s not that one of us is right. Instead, we need to value each others opinion and realize we both might be right.  

## How to apologise 
- I have done this 
- This made you feel this way
- I'm sorry 
- I did this because of these reasons
- I shouldn't have done that and instead I should have done Y 
- Going forward, I want to make sure X 

## Relationship actions
- Show that you care
  - Buy her flowers when she doesn't expect it
  - Go the extra mile on date night: light up that candle and wear that shirt
  - 'Hey I see you - let's do something special together. Let's make memories that last'
  - Give her compliments - look into her eyes and say she's beautiful 
  - Say 'I love you' and 'You are beautiful' whilst looking her in the eyes. 
  - Write her cute texts every so often 
  - Leave some hints for her to see every now and then 
- Take initiative
  - Ideate things to do when together that you both enjoy doing 
  - If this can occassionally have an element of surpise, even better
- Give one another personal space: two independently happy people want to do their own thing at times. And we need to trust one another in that we don't do wrong things in the meantime. Without this trust, the entire relationship is based on the wrong things. 
- Share your life with other friends
- Put yourself in her shoes. How much care do I show? How well do I listen to her concerns? How well do I support her? How much love do I show her? How significant do I make her feel? How much does he love you and how certain are you that he’s going to stay and love you? How much desire, surprise, playfulness does he bring home to you that you don’t expect? How much are you growing together? How much do you feel like he is trying to contribute to you? So score yourself on these points and you’re left with how Cisem feels in the relationship. Put yourself in her shoes - what would you do in this case?
- What do I bring to the other person? Why would she want to be a part of my life? 
- Attend to the little things. Attend to little kindnesses and courtesies 

## General
- The only thing we control is our contribution to the relationship. Keep working on making things better and being the best version of yourself.
- Remember that we all want to be happy. So when I'm stressed, don't take that out on her. Save your headaches for yourself and be in the moment appreciating your relationship instead. 
- Speak the right love language and keep our emotional love tanks filled at all times 
- The worst reasons to keep a relationship going. Note that these are all coming from a strong lack of self confidence:
  - You are afraid of being alone
  - You don't know if you'll find something quite as good
  - You don't want to go back into the dating world 
- Be aware that some things are likely to never change. If something is a big problem right now, consider whether you'd be willing to put up with it for the more distant future. If nothing changed in the next 5 years, then what? Don't waste time. 
- Reflect often on all the ways your partner has positively affected your life
- Be outcome independent and generally just have the confidence that everything will end up just fine, no matter which stage you are in a relationship. You should be prepared to lose everything you have. This makes you value it so much more. 
- Whenever there are small annoyances, first see if you can stop being annoyed by it before you ask them to change.  
- Be the man she needs you to be, not the man you think she wants you to be. Be strong. Be kind. Be reliable. Be honest. You're a man, not a boy. Act like it.
- The grass is not greener on the other side, it's greener where you water it.
- Solving issues: remember that it's you and your partner vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner.
- A relationship is two people in a team. If one person is not happy, the team is not succeeding 
- Be careful in a relationship to not get controlling or change too much from your own identify - don't become complacent. It destroys the reasons why your partner fell for you in the first place
- Afford your spouse the benefit of the doubt. If you have been happy for such a long period, that is the case for good reason. Be patient and focus on the many aspects of her that still exist that caused you to fall in love in place.”
- You need to believe that your SO cares as much about you as you do about them for a relationship to ultimately be successfull 
- If a relationship is not really advancing and you feel its running in circles, don't continue it. Instead, break and go find your better place. Don't delay the inevitable. - Be careful to not go into a relationship that might be fun for now but where no clear future is on the outline. 
- You fall out of love when you want to spend more time alone than with the other person. When the frustration and resentment don't pass. When, deep down, you don't have the desire to try and fix what's wrong after the dust has settled
- Ask yourself whether this is a relationship problem or a person problem. If it’s something that could happen again in a next relationship, work it out as otherwise you’ll repeat history. Eg don’t leave until you communicate. If it’s person specific it’s different
- A lot of people stay in relationships because it’s comfortable and leaving comfort is scary. And then they end up in an unhappy marriage with kids etc. 
-	No relationship is the same. They are all unique in their own ways. You will never have what you had and it will be different. 
- First relationships are often difficult because you have no benchmark and there will also be a curiosity to figure out what else is out there 
- There is this odd feeling where a life should be lived with someone else to make the most out of life. Travelling, intimacy, being as close to someone else. But the reality is that we don’t control other people so we can be in a long term relationship it can also quickly break for whatever reason. And yes we are probably social creatures meant to be together with someone else but often that’s not always the case. It takes a lot of time to find someone that could fit and you get along with and then it also needs to be mutual. It’s worth waiting for whilst you try to become the very best version of yourself first
- Relationship pros: sex, physical touch (kiss, hug, spoon), someone to share things with and constant emotional support, someone to do fun things with. Financial sharing
- Relationship cons: anxiety around relationship. Dealing with issues. Not being able to do just what I want to do


## Reflect during a relationship
- Be in touch with feelings when in a relationship. Am I as excited as I should be? Are we compatible? Do I see us being 40 looking after kids or would I feel like there is more to life? What does your gut say? Does it all feel right? Am I doing this because it's expected and everyone around me is getting engaged/married/have kids or am I actually excited about this relationship and the person? I need to be more realistic: 
  - This is my life as well and I don’t want to end up somewhere average. I value myself too much for that 
  - There are things that are fixable but if values differ you need to be able to step away and be honest to each other 
  - Realize that if I want to end things, that’s best for the relationship and for us both long term 
- In a relationship I need to ask myself: 
  - Is it the best relationship I think I’d ever have? 
  - Is it the best relationship friendship I think I’d ever had? 
  - Could I possibly be happier with someone else or is there no way I could be happier?

### Criteria for a good relationship 
- Living independent happy lives
- Timing is right: not in a relationship and no toxicity from previous relationships
- Stable in most areas in life 
- We have the same ideas about a future - compatible on things like wedding, children, where to live etc. 
- Chemistry: How do you feel when you're together. You need to feel good when you're together. Chemistry doesn't change - if it's not there in the beginning it won't grow. 5 dimensions to chemistry: 
  - Comfort 
    - You genuinely like your partner and your partner makes you feel they genuinely like you 
    - It’s easy to talk to and listen to each other 
    - Communication is open and flows freely 
    - You never feel judged 
    - You can share your deepest thoughts and feelings

## Love languages
Think of it as it: every has a tank filled with emotions. Once the tank with love emotions becomes empty, the relationship is in serious danger. Our goal is to make sure that the love tank of our partner is always full. A full love tank and a healthy relationship enables us to reach our full potential. Without it, we will always be missing that part of our lives. Just ask her how full it is and what you can possibly do to make it even fuller. 

To discover your love language: 
- What hurts you when your spouse does something? The opposite is a primary language 
- What have you requested most often from your spouse? That’s likely an important love language 
- I what way do you express love?

**Words of affirmation**
- Give your spouse compliments. This is not just about how they look, it can be something like: I really appreciate you doing the dishes tonight. 
- Words of affirmation also include encouraging words: support your spouse in them achieving their goals. This will only work when your spouse is in fact looking to achieve these goals in the first place. 
- Kind words: be extremely honest when you give compliments. When we are hurt, we need to communicate that clearly and state it in such a way that shows that we care. “I felt disappointed and hurt that you didn’t help me tonight”. This is showing that you are open and vulnerable – you want your spouse to know how you feel and this shows that you care 
- Humble words: when you need something from your spouse, make requests, not demands and be kind. 

**Quality time**
- Quality conversation – talk about experiences, thoughts, feelings and desires. Key here is that I should not analyse someone else’s situation and provide my thoughts around what the person should or should not do. Instead, I should listen and only provide my thoughts when this is asked for. People want to sympathy and to be listened to – show them that you understand the pressure and stress that you are a part of. People want to be understood  
- Learning to talk – quality conversation is not just listening to the other. It is also making yourself vulnerable and sharing your feeling and emotions. Allow your spouse in your life. In order to do so, become more aware of your own emotions. E.g. keep a small notebook and make notes whenever you feel certain emotions. 
- Quality activities. Do things together that you both like doing. Sometimes, you also just need to do something that your spouse really wants to do. You do these things because you care about her and want to keep her love tank full. Also, she will then do things with you that you care strongly about whereas she cares less strong about those things. 
  - Ask your spouse for a list of activities that she’d like to do and then step by step do these activities. 
  - Set aside time every week to ask one another deeply personal and hard questions. Perhaps give the questions in advance so the other can think about them: best / worst teacher, influence of religion, when were you the proudest, etc.   
  - Discuss a chapter of a book you’re both reading 

**Gifts**
This expresses that you think of the other person and that is all that matters – not the actual value of the gift. To get a feeling of what to give, listen to your spouse as she will most likely drop some notes now and then about what she’d like to receive / get. Another good indication is seeing what she has bought others or what she got excited about. Do not wait for special occasions to give gifts. Amazing gifts are the one where you do something yourself. Sometimes, the best gift to give is yourself – this is when your spouse needs you to just be present at important moments. 

**Acts of service** 
Doing things your spouse would like you to do. Clean things, fix things, do things when she’s not in the mood or doesn’t have time. 

**Physical touch**
Hold hands, touch, kiss, hug, and have sex. To understand where/how to touch your spouse, ask him/her. Put your hand on her shoulder or slightly bump into each other when in the kitchen. 

## Gifts

- Ideas could always be around experiences and something personal or handmade
- Keep a running log of things they'd like to have 

*What I look for in a relationship*
- A person that you are 1) Sexually attracted to 2) Emotionally connected with 3) Makes you happy by just being themselves
- I am happy with the life I live by myself but sharing with the partner makes everything better
- Someone I can share everything and the other way around as well because we are so close. And this resulting in good conversation because we know one another so well. 
- Having the support back bone - someone I can always reach out to and knowing they'll be there to help out and support where they can 
- Feeling that we could build a future together - i.e. visualizing living in a house with kids

- Ambitious and working towards goals
- Confident 
- Someone who can have a lot of discipline and go through tough challenges

Other notes
Deal with being possessive
- tell your partner what's bothering you
- explain why it is that it bothers you, how it makes you feel
- don't try to change the other person
- find the underlying reasons for why things make you feel the way they do (fears? previous experiences?)

Deal with being jealous
- talk about your fears, openly and immediately. Even if you think you're being irrational.
- jealousy is a symptom that someone is feeling insecure or threatened
- jealousy comes from someone's needs not being met or someone's being threatened
- people who don't feel threatened don't feel jealous
- jealousy is often rooted in other emotions such as fear of loss, feelings of rejection or insecurity (or anything else)
- once the feelings have been identified, ask yourself what these feelings are serving. Are they warning about a real problem or are you jealous for jealousy's sake?
