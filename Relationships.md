# Relationships

## People need to live a happy life 
- Live an independent happy life. If you are happy by yourself, you are attractive to others and the relationship is the cherry on the cake. 
You should never be depending on a relationship for happiness. Then, you can bring the partner in to share the hapiness. Because you're independent and confident and completely happy and at peace with yourself, there will be others who want to share their life with me. You cannot expect someone to love you if you don't love yourself. 
- If this is not in place, you will end up needy, controlling and insecure. This comes from a fear of losing her. Realise that being a confident spouse is the thing that reduces risk of losing her.
- Why would someone be excited to spend their life with you if you are selfish, don’t really have any inspiring hobbies and don’t show that you care that much? Really consider what you have to offer someone else before you can expect someone else to join you on the journey. Esssentially, would she want a kid that has a lot of your characteristics? 
- Once you are independent, confident etc. you also automatically place less weight on a relationship such that when things blow up you don't drown
- In a good relationship, all windows and doors are open - allowing people to move away. But even though there is no trap, you will both stay 
- Don't expect your SO to be the sole source of your happiness and contentment in life. They WILL fail you, and when they do, it will destroy the facade of an identity you've built for yourself.
- "Well, you know the expression, 'Happy wife, happy life?' It's bullshit. They've got it backwards. There's a reason that woman agreed to go out with you, a reason she fell in love with you, and a reason she decided to marry you. And that's you. The moment you give up your hobbies, passions, and interests, the instant you put your happiness aside to please her, you've stopped being the man she fell in love with. And if you're unhappy, how the hell are you going to show her anything else? 'Happy life, happy wife,' my friend."

## What is a relationship?
- Two people who love each other, are intimate (sex, hugging, holding hands), are best friends, are excited to share things with, who are comfortable in each other's presence and who are working towards building a future together. Ideally there is also some form of spark / passion between you. 
- A good relationship is based on trust, honesty, communication, belief in each other and support. 
  - Bond on an emotional level where you deeply understand hopes, dreams, desires, fears, insecurities, experiences, memories and you can support in achieving happiness 
  - It’s about making one another better and having fun in the process 
- You need to feel like excited and good around the idea of spending the rest of your life with the person and each time you wake up you need to feel about the two of you. 
- Someone who supports you, who you support, who makes you laugh. 
- With the man I'm with (since more than 4 years), it's the contrary. He makes every plan seems more exciting when he's part of it. He makes me grow, dream, laugh. I feel more powerful and full of life with him, we dream together, we learn together. This doesn't mean we do everyting together, far from it, we're very independant. But I'm always excited to see him, to spend time with him. And I feel more powerful as an individual, which is gold.


## Relationships can end 
- Every relationship is voluntary. Two people decide and choose daily to love one another - this also means that they can decide to no longer love one another at any point in time
- Everyone's life is short and everyone needs to make the most of their own lives. If that means that someone wants to leave the relationship with you, 
because that would increase their happiness, don't be a blocker on that. Let them go and have their happiness. Do whatever is best for both of you. You care for one another and sometimes the best thing to do is letting go of someone. Ultimately it’s her life, and if she needs to do this to live her best life, that’s what you’ve gotta let her do. Be mature about this. 
- You need to accept that every relationship can end because of various reasons. One might die, one might want to move abroad, one might want to focus on work or go back to university, people may just want to experience life completely first. 
- A relationship needs to be worked on by both people. If one is less invested that the other this will eventually cause issues - people stay in these relationships only to figure out years later that fundamentally, it was a waste of time. 

## Breaks
- Sometimes people want space and a break. You just have to let her know that you still care, but that you know she needs space, and that's what you're trying to give her. 
- Realize that healthy relationships don't often need a break - you just work things out together. So even if there is a break, make sure there is regular communication otherwise there is a bomb just waiting to explode. Also, the break should last 2 weeks max, otherwise you just drift further apart and get used to life without each other. 
- During breaks: 
  - Reflect on the relationship - your feelings, what you want and and any things you'd like to do differently for the relationship. Also, take time to reflect on the feelings she communicated with you. With this break, remind yourself what you and your partner have, what he or she brings to your life, and how much he or she means to you. Remind yourself of all the reasons why you love her
  - Meet friends and family
  - Pick up hobbies you haven't pursued for a while  
  - Allow yourself to feel lonely and get back used to what that feels like
  - Don't think about the possible outcomes as those are outside of your control
  - Don't play a victim role - she can do whatever she wants to do whenever she wants. Playing a victim won't help anything or anyone
  - To a certain extend, a break is a stress test within the relationship: can you work it out or is it not worth it for either of you? 
  - 

## Breakups
- Take time to grieve. It's okay to feel this way
- Get completely into something: work out, boxing etc. 
- Meet friends and family 
- Be grateful that you're still healthy, have friends and family you can rely on for support and that you're responsible for making an amazing life yourself. 
- Think about the fact that it wasn't meant to be. The change of two people meeting and being good enough for each other during a lifetime is quite small 
- Each breakup gives you more experience, more reflection, a better understanding of yourself and of what you want out of life 
- If it helps, consider your ex has passed away. That could also be an outcome and you'd now also be left alone. However, your frame of mind would be different. 
- Life is too short not to enjoy. Smile and put one foot in front of the other. Just keep going. 
- I deserve someone who loves me as much as I love her, who is at least willing to fight as much as me for the relationship and who is sure about the relationship - that's where real life can shine. If this isn't the case, it's a lot better to let them go 
- The idea of the relationship is no longer there. She wasn't perfect - otherwise she wouldn't have done this. 
- Don't be a 'doormat' ending up as a friend for emotional support
- Remember that sometimes the issue is with the person. No matter the relationship he or she is in, it might just never really work out by default. 
- Be thankful it happens whenever it does and not later as you'd just have wasted even more time eventually 
- Don't go out of your way to completely change yourself to be good for the relationship you're in. Instead, become the very best version of yourself not some portrait of what others want you to be. Don't pretend to be someone you are fundamentally not
- Be grateful of what you had and what you learned. You could also have never met.
- Your life doesn’t stop there at all. It’s an experience you’ve had and you need to be grateful of what you’ve had. And then move on and see what else life has to offer you
- When someone wants to leave and you don't, it's likely a bad match. The other person likely sees something you don't because you're trapped in your mind and too close to it. In time, you'll see the whole picture for what it is.
- No contact is key - focus on yourself, don't reach out and don't be a creep. If they want to reach out, they will. But that's not your priority
- It will result in dreaming about the other person
- The reasons for breaking up that something tells you could be different from the actual reasons. They tell themselves a convenient truth as well - its all based on feelings and emotions and these change frequently for everybody 
- We also cannot think ‘what if’ – these are assumptions and the whole dynamic would have been different – not necessarily better or worse 
- A good way to get closure is to just be honest. I love you and I care for you. If there are things that I need to grow in for us to be happy together, I will give it my all. If you don’t feel the same or you don’t allow me to do this, that’s fine but at least I tried
- You don’t owe each other anything and can break up for any reason if you want to. It mig  he hurt but it’s better than dragging along knowing nothing is going to come from it and the other person not feeling as loved
- Dumper and dumpee: 
  - Dumper would also have wanted this to work out. They will doubt their decisions over time whereas in the beginning they may be relieved as they did part of their grieving before they broke up. They might realise the grass isn't always greener on the other side 
  - Dumper is going through hell initially but they'll work their ass off to get better coming out stronger 

## How to get over a breakup
- Initially, grief and reflect hard on the relationship and take time to understand what you miss. The next relationship will benefit from all the learning from this phase. 
- A one sided relationship where you're the main one loving won't sustain and would only bring me unhappiness over time. We both deserve a relationship where two people love one another completely  
- If someone doesn't see a future with me or doesn't want to be with me, they are not the one - period 
- See the positive - focus purely on yourself. Realize that single time might be the most precious time in our life as we get to do exactly what we want to do. Learn, experience and go wild. We mostly only change when we're out of our comfort zone so this is a great opportunity to change. 
- Think about the future with curiosity - what else does life have in store for me? What makes life interesting is that things happen and we deal with them. 
- Be grateful of what you had and cherish the memories. They're part of your book now. This is the end of a chapter. The new chapters will be exciting as new things will happen and new people will be met. If the last chapter would have continued for much longer, the book might not have been worth reading. 
- A relationship is only one part of life. There are many other parts that need to be good such that when the relationship breaks, you should have your backup. 
- Take it all for what it is. You can't do anything about it and just move on. 

## Relationships take work & communication is key
- Being in a good relationship takes effort because you don't want to become complacent and take things for granted. That causes the other person to lose interest in you because you're no longer a challenge and you probably no longer really contribute to the other person's happiness. It also means that all of a sudden you'll be afraid of losing her as she's all you have in your life.  
- Passion is important, especially for the beginning of a relationship, but it's dedication and commitment that carry a relationship through the years.
- The thing that keeps a relationship going is honest communication 
  - Share specifically how you feel about the relationship and be honest
  - Talk about the future more often and make sure you’re aligned on expectations at all times
  - Speak about our wants and expectations more clearly
  - Apologize where required and more importantly, show that you change 
  - Really listen to concerns - especially when the same things come up frequently (e.g. cleaning)
  - Take her concerns and action on them but not because she wants you to. If you disagree, mention it and say find a compromise that works for both. Be a bit of a challenge and not just some people pleaser that is easy to walk over
  - When women are venting about their problems they just want you to listen. They don't want advice on how to fix the situation.
  - Set aside time to work on the relationship:
    - What we like / What we don’t like What we’d like to see more of 
    - How are things going / where are we heading / is that the right direction? 
- It's easy to not communicate and let feelings and annoyances build inside of you - eventually this will backfire and blow up however

## Apologizing
- I have done this 
- This made you feel this way
- I'm sorry 
- I did this because of these reasons
- I shouldn't have done that and instead I should have done Y 
- Going forward, I want to make sure X 

## Relationship actions
- Show that you care
  - Buy her flowers when she doesn't expect it
  - Go the extra mile on date night: light up that candle and wear that shirt
  - 'Hey I see you - let's do something special together. Let's make memories that last'
  - Give her compliments - look into her eyes and say she's beautiful 
  - Say 'I love you' and 'You are beautiful' whilst looking her in the eyes. 
  - Write her cute texts every so often 
  - Leave some hints for her to see every now and then 
- Take initiative
  - Ideate things to do when together that you both enjoy doing 
  - If this can occassionally have an element of surpise, even better
- Give one another personal space: two independently happy people want to do their own thing at times. And we need to trust one another in that we don't do wrong things in the meantime. Without this trust, the entire relationship is based on the wrong things. 
- Share your life with other friends

## General
- The only thing we control is our contribution to the relationship. Keep working on making things better and being the best version of yourself.
- Remember that we all want to be happy. So when I'm stressed, don't take that out on her. Save your headaches for yourself and be in the moment appreciating your relationship instead. 
- Speak the right love language and keep the emotional love tank filled at all times 
- The worst reasons to keep a relationship going. Note that these are all coming from a strong lack of self confidence:
  - You are afraid of being alone
  - You don't know if you'll find something quite as good
  - You don't want to go back into the dating world 
- Be aware that some things will never change. If something is a big problem right now, consider whether you'd be willing to put up with it for the more distant future. If nothing changed in the next 5 years, then what? Don't waste time. 
- Reflect often on all the ways your partner has positively affected your life
- If a relationship is not really advancing and you feel its running in circles, don't continue it. Instead, break and go find your better place. Don't delay the inevitable
- Be outcome independent and generally just have the confidence that everything will end up just fine, no matter which stage you are in a relationship. You should be prepared to lose everything you have. This makes you value it so much more. 
- Whenever there are small annoyances, first see if you can stop being annoyed by it before you ask them to change.  
- Both people should be completely invested to make the relationship work. 
- "Be the man she needs you to be, not the man you think she wants you to be. Forget every cliche you've seen in movies and TV shows. Be strong. Be kind. Be reliable. Be honest. You're a man, not a boy. Act like it."
- "If she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for."
- Once you make a decision to be with someone, it's family. It's not going to be always great but you stick to your guns. Don't run away when things are getting hard. There will be days when you can't each other but other days when you love each other like never before. 
- The grass is not greener on the other side, it's greener where you water it.
- Solving issues: remember that it's you and your partner vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner.
- A relationship is two people in a team. If one person is not happy, the team is not succeeding 
- Be careful in a relationship to not get controlling or change too much from your own identify - don't become complacent. It destroys the reasons why your partner fell for you in the first place
- Afford your spouse the benefit of the doubt. If you have been happy for such a long period, that is the case for good reason. Be patient and focus on the many aspects of her that still exist that caused you to fall in love in place.”
- You need to believe that your SO cares as much about you as you do about them for a relationship to ultimately be successfull 
- Be careful to not go into a relationship that might be fun for now but where no clear future is on the outline. 
- You fall out of love when you want to spend more time alone than with the other person. When the frustration and resentment don't pass. When, deep down, you don't have the desire to try and fix what's wrong after the dust has settled
- Put yourself in her shoes. How much care do I show? How well do I listen to her concerns? How well do I support her? How much love do I show her? How significant do I make her feel? How much does he love you and how certain are you that he’s going to stay and love you? How much desire, surprise, playfulness does he bring home to you that you don’t expect? How much are you growing together? How much do you feel like he is trying to contribute to you? So score yourself on these points and you’re left with how Cisem feels in the relationship. Put yourself in her shoes - what would you do in this case?
- A relationship is two people trying to make it work and giving it a full 100%
- o	Ask yourself whether this is a relationship problem or a person problem. If it’s something that could happen again in a next relationship, work it out as otherwise you’ll repeat history. Eg don’t leave until you communicate. If it’s person specific it’s different

### Criteria for a good relationship

- We have the same ideas about a future - compatible on things like wedding, children, where to live etc.

## Gifts
- The gesture matters - it's about showing love and appreciation
- Ideas could always be around experiences and something personal or handmade
- Keep a running log of things they'd like to have 

*What I look for in a relationship*
- A person that you are 1) Sexually attracted to 2) Emotionally connected with 3) Makes you happy by just being themselves
- I am happy with the life I live by myself but sharing with the partner makes everything better
- Someone I can share everything and the other way around as well because we are so close. And this resulting in good conversation because we know one another so well. 
- Having the support back bone - someone I can always reach out to and knowing they'll be there to help out and support where they can 
- Feeling that we could build a future together - i.e. visualizing living in a house with kids
- Honest and open communication - ability to have tough conversations and trust 
- Realizing that relationships are often not perfect. However, a good relationship is one where we can smile at each other's imperfection and say that no matter what, you still want them. 
- Wanting to be part of an exciting life they're living. 
- Ambitious and working towards goals
- Confident 
- Someone who can have a lot of discipline and go through tough challenges
- Spontaneous 
- Mature 
- Doing fun things together
  - Both have a good social circle to share and we do active things with them: road trips, sports (even if 'social' sports like darts, shuffle board etc.) 
  - Both enjoy travelling / exploring London 
  - Both enjoy pubs/restaurants/bars for date nights
  - Both enjoy music and looking for exciting things to do that create memories 
  - Someone to share doing sports with: yoga, running, swimming, badminton, frisbee in summer 
  - Do romantic things: snuggle with candles on listening to chill music

*What is required of me*
- Provide fun
- Honesty
- Trustworthy 
- Confident
- Own style and personality
- Good social circle
- Protectice
- Masculine 
- Look after yourself 
- Fit
- Know how to deal with people and make people feel good 
- Sharing my feelings and being honest and open in communication 

### Other
- Be okay with rejection and loss of those you love    
  - Eventually, people can die, become incredibly sick, have large personal problems to deal with or just change and the result of all these things can be that I lose those I love. In those cases, I need to live my life alone and knowing that, should prepare me to always be happy independent because I cannot control other people. And I should only ever focus on what I can control. Old people are often alone at the end of their lives as their spouse may have passed away.
  - Similarly, when I start dating again, I will face rejection tons of time. This is not to be taken personal as there are plenty of reasons why people don’t want to commit. But I need to be aware that rejection is a part of life
- Be in touch with feelings when in a relationship. Am I as excited as I should be? Are we compatible? Do I see us being 40 looking after kids or would I feel like there is more to life? What does your gut say? Does it all feel right? Am I doing this because it's expected and everyone around me is getting engaged/married/have kids or am I actually excited about this relationship and the person? I need to be more realistic: 
	This is my life as well and I don’t want to end up somewhere average. I value myself too much for that 
	There are things that are fixable but if values differ you need to be able to step away and be honest to each other 
	Realize that if I want to end things, that’s best for the relationship and for us both long term 

- Be with someone who allows you to be yourself entirely. Someone who lets you dance and sing and you can be completely comfortable around
- When you stop having the hard conversations and arguments, ask why. You might be too rational and going with the flow which could ultimately backfire. 
- Don't pressure people into doing things my way. Instead, communicate and find compromises/middle grounds 
- o	A lot of people stay in relationships because it’s comfortable and leaving comfort is scary. And then they end up in an unhappy marriage with kids etc. 
- o	In a relationship I need to ask myself: 
	Is it the best relationship I think I’d ever have? 
	Is it the best relationship friendship I think I’d ever had? 
	Could I possibly be happier with someone else or is there no way I could be happier?



Overall learnings 
-	You don’t forget people that were close to you and you won’t replace them. They’ll always have a place in your heart
-	No relationship is the same. They are all unique in their own ways. You will never have what you had 
-	You only realise what you miss once it is already lost 
- I really value being with someone. However, you also want to make sure you are with the right person and that person is worth waiting for. You cannot hurry love because you’re signing up for life 
- First relationships are often difficult because you have no benchmark and there will also be a curiosity to figure out what else is out there 
- Lots of people stay in relationships because it's expected and comfortable. When ultimately they just don't work out as people. Then, years down the line and perhaps even with kids, things might still break
- Staying in a relationship because you're afraid of being lonely or of finding someone else is the worst reason to stay in a relationship
- When someone is trying to break up with me, be a strong person. Showing desparation and crying will make them sympathise and perhaps they can't handle it, meaning they'd stay in the relationship. It also means they would stop being honest with me out of fear of hurting my feelings.
