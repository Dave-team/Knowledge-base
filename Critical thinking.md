# Critical thinking
- The media has its weaknesses, biases and vulnerability to manipulation and deception. Consider what is relevant and the normal outcome in similar situations.
- Accurate information is better than dramatic information. Back up vivid stories with facts and numbers.
- Separate noise and chance events from what is important. Ask: Is it relevant? Does it make sense? Is it representative evidence? Was it a random event?
- Trends may be wrong. Ask: Is it a permanent or temporary effect?  

- We see winners because they get media coverage. We don’t see everyone else who in fact has lost 
- We see the available information. We don’t see what isn’t reported 
- Beware of incentives
- Look at facts independently 
- When looking at data, consider things like survivorship bias, where only the strongest continue doing something and therefore record a positive increase (e.g. counting calories correlates to reduction in fat). So you need to take dropouts into account, people who tried but failed

Spotting bad science
1. Is a relative change (e.g. percentages) used to convince? ‘People who eat no fat live longer’. What does longer exactly mean? 10 days? 3 years? That determines whether it’s actually worth it.
 Another example: ‘People who drink coffee lose 20% more fat than those who don’t.’ It isn’t enough to look at the relative data. What is the absolute in or decrease? Distrust percentages in isolation. Also remember that percentages can come from different sample sizes
2. Does this study claim to show cause and effect? When there is an uncontrolled experiment (also called observational studies), you can only show correlation, you cannot proof cause and effect. This is because uncontrolled experiments cannot control all variables involved.
3. Does the study depend on self reporting or surveys? When we allow people to self fill in their data, this is very often plain wrong because people often don’t really know the answers. Instead, record things directly when they actually happen.
4. Is this study claiming a control group? In diet studies, this is pretty much impossible to just change one macronutrient variable.
5. Do the funders of the study have a vested interest in a certain outcome?
