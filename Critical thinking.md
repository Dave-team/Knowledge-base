# Critical thinking
- The media has its weaknesses, biases and vulnerability to manipulation and deception. Consider what is relevant and the normal outcome in similar situations.
- Accurate information is better than dramatic information. Back up vivid stories with facts and numbers.
- Separate noise and chance events from what is important. Ask: Is it relevant? Does it make sense? Is it representative evidence? Was it a random event?
- Trends may be wrong. Ask: Is it a permanent or temporary effect?  

- We see winners because they get media coverage. We don’t see everyone else who in fact has lost 
- We see the available information. We don’t see what isn’t reported 
- Beware of incentives
- Look at facts independently 
- When looking at data, consider things like survivorship bias, where only the strongest continue doing something and therefore record a positive increase (e.g. counting calories correlates to reduction in fat). So you need to take dropouts into account, people who tried but failed

## Spotting bad science
1. Is a relative change (e.g. percentages) used to convince? ‘People who eat no fat live longer’. What does longer exactly mean? 10 days? 3 years? That determines whether it’s actually worth it.
 Another example: ‘People who drink coffee lose 20% more fat than those who don’t.’ It isn’t enough to look at the relative data. What is the absolute in or decrease? Distrust percentages in isolation. Also remember that percentages can come from different sample sizes
2. Does this study claim to show cause and effect? When there is an uncontrolled experiment (also called observational studies), you can only show correlation, you cannot proof cause and effect. This is because uncontrolled experiments cannot control all variables involved.
3. Does the study depend on self reporting or surveys? When we allow people to self fill in their data, this is very often plain wrong because people often don’t really know the answers. Instead, record things directly when they actually happen.
4. Is this study claiming a control group? In diet studies, this is pretty much impossible to just change one macronutrient variable.
5. Do the funders of the study have a vested interest in a certain outcome?

## Factfulness notes
- People tend to talk in terms of extremes. Do not fall for that and realize most cases are average / in between the extreme cases. Therefore, instead of talking about extremes or even averages, look at the distribution instead 
- The news is about drama and negativity – constant improvement would never make the news. That’s why people tend to think the world is in a bad state. However, most things in the world are getting better, but they are still bad. Combine the negativity of the day with the statistical knowledge that things are getting better. 
- Remember that lines very rarely continue to go straight in their trajectory. Any trend currently going straight is much more like to be part of a line that has many fluctuations 
- Recognize when frightening things get our attention and remember that these are not necessarily the most risky. Terror attacks get your attention, but it’s more like to die as a pedestrian. Our natural fear of violence make us overestimate these risks. Instead, calculate the risk: danger X exposure. Make sure to become calm when afraid as people make bad decisions in a stressful state
- Never really trust a single number. Instead, compare it to another number or normalize it by dividing it with something else
- Beware of generalizations: not everything within a group is the same – there is a large distribution within groups (e.g. UK might be rich as a country but there’s still homeless people). Do not assume that things are the same everywhere – e.g. a leg between a lift in India causes the leg to break. 
- Marginal improvements lead to big changes over time. Keep updating your knowledge and stand back by much things have changed over the years 
- Avoid the single perspective instinct and look at problems from many directions. Find people who disagree/challenge you and test your own ideas. Be humble about what you don’t know. Also be aware of the expertise of others. When you’ve been involved with something for a long time, you tend to exaggerate the importance and it’s hard to change. 
- Things happen for multiple reasons. Look for causes, don’t just blame someone – instead, spend energy to understand the system that caused the issue and make sure it doesn’t happen again. Similarly, when someone does something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway rather than letting someone blow their own trumpet
- Remember that things are rarely urgent. Ask for more time and information as we tend to not think clearly in times of urgency. It’s rarely now or never and it’s rarely either/or. Urgent things should be measured – insist on the data. Any prediction about the future is uncertain. Insist on a full range of scenarios and ask how often predictions were right before
