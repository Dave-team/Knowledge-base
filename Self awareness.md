# Self awareness
## Principles
- Three questions to answer
    - Who am I?
    - What do I want out of life?
    - What do I value in life? 
- Keep good memories close to you 
- Have the ability to answer tough live questions. What’s you earliest childhood memory? Biggest failure? What are your parents like? Most emotional moment? Most happy/ proud moment? Etc.
- Find out about myself and be able to answer questions and tell interesting stories. Learn yourself better and know things about yourself you can say that are interesting
- Spend time reflecting what my ideal life looks like. How do I spend my weekdays, my weekends, who do I engage with and to which extend? Who knows me, how do I act around others. How do I think? What do I do when not at work or in a social setting? What do I value?  
- I’ve spent my early twenties searching for what I want to do and who I want to be. Life will continue to be a search but rather than forcefully searching, let's pause now and enjoy the present moments. And it’s about becoming better at where I am rather than contiueing to strive for somewhere I want to be. Focus on me as a person rather than an external goal that is beyond my own person. And the relationship has put me into this perspective - I was not able to love fully, I was always thinking, I was never happy to just relax as my monkey mind was always on
- I want to get to know myself and either be happy with who I am or change the things I am not happy about by getting after it. 

## Findings 
### Action on life rather than procrastinate by consuming content 
Rather than actually focusing on goals, hobbies and fighting my inner demons, I tend to consume content as a way of procrastination from the things I actually should be doing. I also have this Knowledge Base now that I keep improving and extending rather than fully using. The value lies in going deep in some content rather than always looking for something new - the FOMO is irrational as I likely already have most useful content directly in here and in a few fundamental books. The person I want to be and the life I want to live is not found by consuming content. 

### Set in my way
I am extremely set in my way: ‘what would you be if you weren’t X’. I’m so focused on my path that I forgot to think outside of it. Everything is just pretty practical in my mind and the fantasy has died a bit. 

### All or nothing thinking 
I tend to be in a place where I'm working on one thing entirely and then I struggle to maintain the balance with other things going on in life. E.g. I would either focus on mathematics/cooking and I couldn't really see myself balancing these things. 

### Be more relaxed
Man’s greatest problems arise because he is unable to sit still by himself. I find it hard to do 'nothing' as in something that fundamentally isn't productive which is either work or learning. But these moments are often the best in life. And when I do something that isn't productive, I immediately want to optimise the process to finish as fast as possible - I focus on the 'goal' and stop enjoying the process. I want to finish a book rather than enjoying it - so I become anxious reading a book because I want to finish it - even though that is not the actual objective of reading. 

Life is not a race - it's about enjoying things at the present time. 

### Calm mind 
I’d like to have a more calm mind and more optimism and confidence that things will be okay. This is the biggest key to life. 

### Do the hard strategic work
I tend to default to asking someone else when a difficult or strategic piece of work needs to be decided on or implemented. Instead, to advance my career I should assume completely ownership myself - what would I do if I was the one deciding? 

### Be patient and tackle challenges with a positive attitube
I get annoyed when things don't go well - this in turn affects my mood. I want things to finish quickly and when something hinders me from doing that, and I can't figure it out, I get annoyed. 

### The world isn't black and white
Realize that not everything is black and white / binary, there are multiple ways of doing things and not everyone is like me and I'm not always right. 

### Lower the pressure on yourself / Don't take yourself so seriously
I tend to put really high pressure on myself constantly. Very high standards and never taking the easier way out. I think this is from the early expectation that was put on me that second place doesn't matter - you need to win. This has led me to always want to achieve perfection which in my mind would only be feasible through incredible hard work. I always thought I could become this 'Ubermensch' but why even strive for it as the process makes me unhappy and the goal is unrealistic. At uni, I wasn't happy with a 9 as a grade 

### Let go of control
I tend to want to control things. When I have to wait or when I don't know the next steps, I become very anxious as I'm not steering the direction. This might come from a fundamental lack of trust - it is probably okay to just trust the process and action things when they go out of hand and let go of things in the meantime. 

### Feeling of needing to be busy 
I always feel as if I am meant to be this hustler, always on the move, always progressing. And I have put this energy into this development I'm doing but maybe it should be aimed at other things that would help other people - charity, volunteering. 

### Everything needs a purpose
I always had this idea that everything I do needs a purpose. Learning guitar? Why, what does it bring me? I only ever wanted to do things that would get me further in life - they were logical and practical. I am in the race. This might be related to a fear of regret. When I'm 50, I want to look back and be happy at what I did. I have been searching for what that contentment looks like but probably that contentment is just from enjoying the moment. 


### Don't overthink / think obsessively
I have a strong tendency to overthink things. This is split between: 
- overthinking about what might happen in the future (anxiety) 
- overthinking something that happened and I think about all different contexts related to that. 
- overthinking a most optimal way to do something 
- overthinking a decision to be made 
  
Examples where overthinking is intense: 
- Deciding between taking a job during COVID (Guardian). I wasn't able to focus on doing anything else than constantly thinking about which path to take
- Why did someone breakup with me? 
- How should I go about getting a drivers lincese? After all that thinking, I still hadn't taken a lesson

### Be aware of feelings and emotions and communicate them
I find it hard to understand my own feelings and find that I'm am often slightly out of touch with my feelings. Even when I do feel them, I often don't share them and just keep being closed. Any relationship is based on us understanding ourselves and sharing our feelings openly and honestly. 

### Social
#### Personality 
- I am introverted 
- It's hard for me to speak up when a conversation jumps from one topic to another - I need time to think before speaking
- Conversations in social group settings are often not quite the ones I enjoy most - they are about very superficial topics that I don't have much to share on
- I tend to consider what I say deeply - by the time I'm ready to speak the topic has moved on - I need more time to speak up
- I don’t want to interrupt others 
- It's easy for me to just listen in and become a passive observer of the conversation

Believing that other people are more important and therefore always doing what others wanted and putting their needs above our own. And then avoiding conflict because she felt bad when others are upset with her.

#### 1-1s 
I feel fine. Usually, the conversation is in depth about a topic we both enjoy talking about 

#### Strangers 1-1
I am not the quickest to introduce myself or generally engage with new people. 

#### Larger group of friends / colleagues
I don't speak up much - probably to avoid having the attention on me. I am nervous when speaking in front of others - i.e. I get uncorfortable when the attention is on me. I also don't feel good about speaking about myself. I feel attacked / judged and tend to see comments as an attack on my value. I have a feeling that others are better than me. My thinking: 
- If I say something: 
  - What would they think of me? Would they find me boring, uninteresting? 
  - What could their follow up question or comment be? I'm not sure I am willing/able to answer that question, especially if those questions are personal. Maybe I don't even know myself well enough to answer that question. 
  - They might discover who I really am - someone who is ultimately quite boring without hobbies except for personal development 
- When a questions is being asked to the group and I don't feel comfortable around it: 'What kind of animal are you?' I tend to just get stuck. These type of questions are very on the spot and I don't have the time to think about it. This goes in the way of me thinking that my answer should be 'perfect' and that makes me anxious and not willing to share. 
- I tend to think that I should remain quiet unless I have something to add. So if its not personal, I'd think that my contribution to whatever is being talked about would not be relevant or otherwise interesting. And otherwise, I might think that the topic discussed is not very interesting to me - this would be because of my narrow mindedness 
- If someone comments, I know that I'll take that personally and that is coming from a lack of self esteem as I'm not sure it's the right thing. 
- It comes from being very self conscious and from a fear of being rejected

#### Work: team meetings 
I feel anxiety around presenting what I've done and what I'll be working on. There are probably three main reasons for this: 

1. There is some level of imposter syndrome. 
   1. Have I worked on the right things?
   2. Am I doing these things right? 
   3. Have I worked hard enough?
2. I am afraid I'm not meeting the expectations of others. I tend to want to please people and when I don't 100% believe I've done things perfectly (to the expectations of others), I feel like a slight let down to the other people, which in my mind would lead them to think I'm either incompetent to work on the right things in a smart way or that I'm simply not working hard enough. I am afraid that what I'm working on is not to the approval of others. 
3. I am afraid of being nervous - causing me to be even more nervous. And I probably don't necessarily mind being nervous but I'm nervous that my nervousness caused me to tremble and not speak with the level of clarity and confidence I would like. 

#### Work: non team meetings 
I don't speak up in meetings much as I am afraid of asking stupid questions, give obvious recommendations. I am 'just' the data person - everyone know surely would already have thought of what I'm thinking? Who am I to have an opinion here? The conversations tend to flow fast and everyone speaks up - it's hard to follow and I'm not someone who very bluntly cuts someone off. I also think I wouldn't be listened to as someone else would already have overspoken me which reduces me enthusiasm around speaking further. And then I'm anxious around saying something stupid or generally something that doesn't add value. 

### Judging
- When I see people, I judge: e.g. fat/skinny
- When someone does something I don't really agree with, I judge: this is good/this is bad. And often I then portray that to myself and put a value judgement on it.
- Why do I judge others? I judge because I think black and white. I have a fixed path in my mind of what everyone should be like so when someone is different, I consider that bad. 

### Relationship findings
- I fear being rejected - particularly feeling as if I'm not good enough which hits my self esteem. If I am confident enough, I don't care when one person rejects me - there are many others who are happy to be with me. And even if not, I am happy with my independent life. The goal here is to be outcome independent 
- I fear losing those I love. People die, people change. Losing those we love is a major part of life that everyone needs to deal with. 
- I tend to see the positives only. When I'm comfortable and relatively happy it's hard for me to see negatives. Instead, have regular critical check-ins with yourself and ask yourself how it's going and where it's going. And don't fall in the trap of loving someone just because they love you and that feels good. Value yourself more than that. 
- I am a people pleaser and probably wouldn't quickly reject/break up with someone purely out of fear. Instead, realise this is your one life - know what you want out of it. If something doesn't sit right, become aware of it. Then communicate it. Then fix it. If it can't be fixed, you need to be strong for the both of you to break things of now rather than waiting any longer. You both deserve better. 
- I am anxious about the future - will I be able to get a new SO when I have been single for so long? Instead, approach life with curiosity - who knows what will happen? Just be happy - then you won't need anyone else.
- I tend to become dependant and complacent during a relationship. Instead, keep living my own life, chase my goals and keep my social cirlce and hobbies. And beyond that, invest in the relationship if it's worthwhile: initiate things, show that you care, communicate honestly, etc.
- I fear being lonely. Don't be lonely - fill your life with purpose, family, friends, hobbies  
- I fear making the wrong decisions - we often make only a few major decisions in our lives and I fear regretting the decision. Decisions are not forever. Give things a chance when it feels right, be in touch with feelings and if it turns out to have been the wrong decision, be strong enough to end things. 
- I crave a strong sense of belonging and validation. I want someone to care about me and I want to know that someone will reply and just be there for me. I want to feel loved and this validation made me feel good about myself; if I don't feel loved this hits my self esteem and makes me not feel good about myself. Seeking external validation from someone you don't fundamentally control is not good. Enjoy it when you have it but be aware that you can't rely on validation that isn't coming from within. 
- At times I felt like my worth was determined by whether I was in a relationship or not. Being with someone is what I’d consider a successful life whereas being single is a sign that my life isn’t complete. This has been amplified by e.g. how family approaches us. Instead, be entirely happy independently first. 
- I have controlling tendencies. I wasn't happy when she would prioritize doing other things over spending time with me during the relationship. It felt as it we had our weekends and she'd always have to spend it with me because I expected it and I probably wouldn't know what else to do with myself. I felt rejected when she would do something else and that hurt my validation and made me fear losing her which made me unattractive. 


### Flying
Tons of flights happen. The pilots wouldn’t fly if there was an issue. Turbulence is just a bumpy road. Try to comfort yourself. Realise it’s okay to feel that way because you’re not in control. But it happens often and the pilots are the right people to take care of it. Statistically, were incredibly safe. Learn about planes. You’re not in control any more so just let it happen. 

Need to get somewhere. I know the feeling and I know my response. From experience, it’ll be just fine / it will soon pass 

### Medical help
it needs to happen because it will help me. Doing it is better than not doing it. The earlier I’m fixed the better 

### Privileged
Extremely lucky being white male and grew up in Netherlands. Worst thing that can happen isn’t that bad - could always go back to Netherlands

### Minimalism
I know that watches (or any materialistic things for that matter) ultimately won't bring happiness. They are a risk to keep for theft or damage, they need to be serviced, the search for watches is time consuming that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere. It's a constant race to reach the next thing. I'm also keen to keep as little things as possible in my life avoid clutter.
