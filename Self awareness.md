# Self awareness
## Principles
- Three questions to answer
    - Who am I?
    - What do I want out of life?
    - What do I value in life? 
- Keep good memories close to you 
- Have the ability to answer tough live questions. What’s you earliest childhood memory? Biggest failure? What are your parents like? Most emotional moment? Most happy/ proud moment? Etc.

## Findings 
### Action over content consumption
I have been a big content consumer lately and rather than actioning and using the learnings, I've continued to consume. My current thoughts on this is that content consumption is a form of FOMO for missing out on key insights of life. However, this very likely is no longer the case with the content I already consumed. The time is now to instead use this newly gained knowledge and go deeper in that. The content consumed is a good hobby but it shouldn't replace life. Taking action is what will ultimately help me become the person I want to be and the experiences I want to gain are not found in the content I'm consuming  

### Be able to do nothing 
- I should stop having this immense desire to do something and 'be productive'. We all need space and relaxation 

### Do the hard strategic work
- I tend to default to asking someone else when a difficult or strategic piece of work needs to be decided on or implemented. What would I do if I was the one deciding? 

### Life is not a race
Oftentimes, I am focused on the end goal and don't enjoy the process. I want to finish a book rather than enjoying it. It's like I'm in a race against I don't know what. Life is not a race - it's about enjoying things at the present time. My main goal is calm mind, great relationships and friendships, and experiencing a lot of things. A job should be enjoyable and should give rise to financial stability. 

### Be patient and solve challenges
I get annoyed when things don't go well - this in turn affects my mood. I want things to finish quickly and when something hinders me from doing that, and I can't figure it out, I get annoyed. To overcome this, I need to accept the challenge as a puzzle to be fixed and that is then my main priority. It's about staying relaxed and sometimes you need to sleep on the problem and then fix it in the morning. 

### The world isn't black and white
Realize that not everything is black and white / binary, there are multiple ways of doing things and not everyone is like me and I'm not always right. So rather than being defense against suggestions, accept other solutions too 

### Lower the pressure on yourself
I tend to put really high pressure on myself constantly. Very high standards and never taking the easier way out.  

### Don't overthink
- I overthink scenarios even before they are relevant - perhaps this is my stoicism? E.g. when searching for a job, I'll use a lot of negative visualization
- With meetings, I tend to overthink how it will go and prepare mentally exactly what I will say. Instead, I'd like to draw on confidence and understanding that I will end up saying the right things
- Often, I just need to take a first step and not want everything to go exactly as planned. E.g. there is no perfect path to taking a driving license but the only way to get it is by actually taking lessons in the first place. Overthinking is procrastination to a large extend 

### Switch your mind
- When I am struggling with decisions, I am unable to work on other things. E.g. having option to take job > can't work on projects. This often means I need to take a step back, take a break and just forget about it if it doesn't feel right.  
- It’s hard for me to switch off my mind e.g. when the weekend comes and I still have work on my mind
- I am someone who can get really caught up on work and that is then all I think about. E.g. in standups I would think about a problem I'd be solving. Or even in general, I'd be less social because my mind is consumed with the project. It's really crucial to be able to step back from the problems and switch mindset, especially towards becoming a manager and becoming more social overall. Take a breath and switch mindset - work hard, play hard. The problems aren't solving themselves because you don't let go of them. The problems will be solved once you give your brain a break 
- When on the phone with spouse, friends, drop everything - don't share your headaches and just be in the moment 

### Communicate feelings honestly 
- I am often slightly out of touch with my feelings - hiding them in myself and not sharing them doesn't help anyone
- Part of me not being 100% is out of fear of losing someone 

### Obsessive thinking
- I tend to be obsessed by my thoughts and then don't allow space for anything else. If there is something I need to do or tell someone, that tends to be all I think about and blocks me from anything else 


### Relationship fears
- I fear being rejected - particularly feeling as if I'm not good enough which hits my self esteem
- I fear losing those I love and I tend to see the positives only. When I'm comfortable and relatively happy it's hard for me to see negatives
- I am a people pleaser and probably wouldn't quickly reject/break up with someone purely out of fear. This is a fundamental sign that I don't value my own life enough 
- I am anxious about the future - will I be able to get a new SO when I have been single for so long? 
- I fear being lonely 
- I fear making the wrong decisions - we often make only a few major decisions in our lives and I fear regretting the decision 
- With all of these, as long as I become an independent happy man who has his shit together, I don't care about the relationship. This also means that I'll be able to take rejection because I date for fun and I'm ok if things don't work out. This lack of confidence would make me dependant and put the girl on a pedastral whihc isn't attractive 
- 

Other 
- I often go into 'let me fix that' mode. Instead, don't give advice and only jump in when people specifically ask for your advice. 
- I crave a strong sense of belonging – I want someone to care about me and I want to know that someone will reply and just be there for me. I want to feel loved 
- At times I felt like my worth was determined by whether I was in a relationship or not. Being with someone is what I’d consider a successful life whereas being single is a sign that my life isn’t complete
- o	I was depending on validation to make me feel good about myself 
	I want people to text me and show they care 
	I want to meet friends regularly 
	I want to go on occasional phone calls 
	I want to feel belonged – being part of a community might help this 
o	Not being loved as much makes me feel inadequate 
-	I wasn’t really living life, I was going through it and being lived by work and the relationship. Clean slate and so many things to now look forward to. Actually setting goals again 
- Until I know exactly who I am, what I need to work on, what my goals and ambitions are I shouldn’t be in a relationship. I’ve been guided by life and I haven’t taken ownership of my life beyond work. I don’t think I knew who I was or what I wanted when I met Cisem - somebody loved me and I loved that feeling so I loved her back and I think that just continued through time.
- Once I know exactly where I’m coming from, who I am and where I’m going, then I have this life build for myself in which I am happy. And this level of happiness means that I have a balance in all areas in life, don’t feel lonely and don’t feel a need to belong and be loved because I found all this elsewhere. I want to be completely happy single and continue to feel that way - all relationships in life end and even if someone were to die, I’d want to be able to withstand that and move on
- The end of the relationship left me more anxious and I noticed a drop in my self esteem 
- The reason I was so obsessed is simply because I didn't have any larger goals that I was working towards. 
- The reason why I feel this way is because I had expectations that we would meet up. Once I realised we were going to meet up that felt like a bad thing and instead I wanted validation by speaking to her or at least get the validation that we’ll see each other again soon. If I practice patience and confidence I know that it will happen - if it doesn’t it’s fine too - be outcome independent and most importantly don’t show desperation and don’t be the one investing too much because the investment isn’t equal
- I tend to overthink and then I try to put things into buckets. Either full on friends or no contact. Not realising that friends might take more time and that that should be put on pause and follow naturally
- Overthinking without going to the source and communicating. I can think all day long but what about just asking someone how they think and be completely honest around my thinking?
- I have a strong tendency to feel bad with sympathy and compassion. I don’t like being sympathies with me. I feel like depression and mental health issues is a weakness and I surely wouldn’t want others to be put up with my weaknesses that I should care for myself

### Calm mind 
I’d like to have a more calm mind and more optimism and confidence that things will be okay 

### Social
- I am nervous when speaking in front of others - i.e. I get uncorfortable when the attention is on me 
- I'm not the biggest fan of speaking about myself. Often, group conversations are about sharing personal stories and I'm not the biggest fan of that. Other than personal stories, a big part of group conversations is on the spot spontaneous comments and I also need to work on that as my creative out of the box thinking is currently limited.  As a consequence I'm often quiet in group conversations. In 1-1 talks, there is often a more purposeful topic so I'm fine. To do: 
    - Improve creative thought
    - Think more about own life and what is worth talking about and mentally prepare talking about these things 
    - If this doesn't flow/work, realize its okay to realize I'm more queiet in social group settings 
- I sometimes feel like missing out on life experiences such as weddings because of a limited social circle. 

### Privileged
Extremely lucky being white male and grew up in Netheralnds. Worst thing that can happen isn’t that bad - could always go back to Netherlands

### Minimalism
- I know that watches (or any materialistic things for that matter) ultimately won't bring happiness. They are a risk to keep for theft or damage, they need to be serviced, the search for watches is time consuming that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere. It's a constant race to reach the next thing  

### Build personality
- So far, my lifestyle has been very square with very few extremely crazy things. To break out of that, I need to do more wild things and spice up my life. 
- Focus less on doing only things that make sense for my development or only finding the 'best' ways to do things. Do things more just for the sake of doing them and don't put so many rules and boundaries.
- Get rid of the checklist mentally and be more freeriding through life 
- Avoid living a life that is textbook 'this is how you should life'. Instead, try some things that non standard 
- Avoid being too goal oriented. Once a goal is reached, the same empty feeling will be back and you can start again. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.

Relationship reflections
-	Co-dependent – she was the main source for my happiness and there was a gap to fill. When she told me there would be a break I stopped knowing what to do.  
-	Complacent and selfish – Cisem was initiating most things and I didn’t have strong opinions on my own. This would have caused her to feel quite busy keeping things going and she must’ve felt like she was looking after me as well 
o	Case in point: I took a day off and had to ask her what some good things to do were
o	What we eat was determined by Cisem
o	What we do was largely determined by Cisem 
-	Never really communicated my appreciation for her and the relationship and doing the small things that make this clear. In short, I haven’t put the required effort in the relationship as I should have been 
-	Relationship was far too scheduled: 
o	Never did anything spontaneous – i.e. on weekdays / meetings her for a quick walk at the office 
o	Didn’t meet friends during weekend because we had to spend time together
o	Started a routine like ritual we wouldn’t deviate from because we had to do things together. 
-	Cisem often mentioned I was obsessed over cleaning/the flat in general (e.g. lifting the chair, being extremely careful with Lola, use coasters) and I never took those concerns and turned them into action. This made her not feel at home and constant on guard to ensure ‘she did what I would approve of’. Sit down and discuss cleaning and what home looks like. Realise the flat is just a temporary accommodation we’ll be out of before we know it. The worst part here is that she repeatedly mentioned these things to the the point of ‘this worries me about living with you’. I simply disregarded these statements 
-	I was pressuring her into having sex rather than giving her time and space to figure it out. Don’t ask for sex until you initiate.
