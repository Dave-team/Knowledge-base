# Self awareness
## Principles
- Three questions to answer
    - Who am I?
    - What do I want out of life?
    - What do I value in life? 
- Keep good memories close to you 
- Have the ability to answer tough live questions. What’s you earliest childhood memory? Biggest failure? What are your parents like? Most emotional moment? Most happy/ proud moment? Etc.

## Findings 
### Action over content consumption
I have been a big content consumer lately and rather than actioning and using the learnings, I've continued to consume. My current thoughts on this is that content consumption is a form of FOMO for missing out on key insights of life. However, this very likely is no longer the case with the content I already consumed. The time is now to instead use this newly gained knowledge and go deeper in that. The content consumed is a good hobby but it shouldn't replace life. Taking action is what will ultimately help me become the person I want to be and the experiences I want to gain are not found in the content I'm consuming  

### Life is not a race
Oftentimes, I am focused on the end goal and don't enjoy the process. I want to finish a book rather than enjoying it. It's like I'm in a race against I don't know what. Life is not a race - it's about enjoying things at the present time. My main goal is calm mind, great relationships and friendships, and experiencing a lot of things. A job should be enjoyable and should give rise to financial stability. 

### Be patient and solve challenges
I get annoyed when things don't go well - this in turn affects my mood. I want things to finish quickly and when something hinders me from doing that, and I can't figure it out, I get annoyed. To overcome this, I need to accept the challenge as a puzzle to be fixed and that is then my main priority. It's about staying relaxed and sometimes you need to sleep on the problem and then fix it in the morning. 

### The world isn't black and white
Realize that not everything is black and white, there are multiple ways of doing things and not everyone is like me and I'm not always right. So rather than being defense against suggestions, accept other solutions too 

### Lower the pressure on yourself
I tend to put really high pressure on myself constantly. Very high standards and never taking the easier way out.  

### Don't overthink
I overthink scenarios even before they are relevant - perhaps this is my stoicism? E.g. when searching for a job, I'll use a lot of negative visualization

### Switch your mind
- When I am struggling with decisions, I am unable to work on other things. E.g. having option to take job > can't work on projects. This often means I need to take a step back, take a break and just forget about it if it doesn't feel right.  
- It’s hard for me to switch off my mind e.g. when the weekend comes
- I am someone who can get really caught up on work and that is then all I think about. E.g. in standups I would think about a problem I'd be solving. Or even in general, I'd be less social because my mind is consumed with the project. It's really crucial to be able to step back from the problems and switch mindset, especially towards becoming a manager and becoming more social overall. Take a breath and switch mindset - work hard, play hard. The problems aren't solving themselves because you don't let go of them. The problems will be solved once you give your brain a break 

### Calm mind 
I’d like to have a more calm mind and more optimism and confidence that things will be okay 

### Social
- I am nervous when speaking in front of others - i.e. I get uncorfortable when the attention is on me 
- I'm not the biggest fan of speaking about myself. Often, group conversations are about sharing personal stories and I'm not the biggest fan of that. Other than personal stories, a big part of group conversations is on the spot spontaneous comments and I also need to work on that as my creative out of the box thinking is currently limited.  As a consequence I'm often quiet in group conversations. In 1-1 talks, there is often a more purposeful topic so I'm fine. To do: 
    - Improve creative thought
    - Think more about own life and what is worth talking about and mentally prepare talking about these things 
    - If this doesn't flow/work, realize its okay to realize I'm more queiet in social group settings 
- I sometimes feel like missing out on life experiences such as weddings because of a limited social circle. 

### Privileged
Extremely lucky being white male and grew up in Netheralnds. Worst thing that can happen isn’t that bad - could always go back to Netherlands

### Minimalism
- I know that watches (or any materialistic things for that matter) ultimately won't bring happiness. They are a risk to keep for theft or damage, they need to be serviced, the search for watches is time consuming that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere. It's a constant race to reach the next thing  

### Build personality
- So far, my lifestyle has been very square with very few extremely crazy things. To break out of that, I need to do more wild things and spice up my life. 
- Focus less on doing only things that make sense for my development or only finding the 'best' ways to do things. Do things more just for the sake of doing them and don't put so many rules and boundaries.
- Get rid of the checklist mentally and be more freeriding through life 
- Avoid living a life that is textbook 'this is how you should life'. Instead, try some things that non standard 
- Avoid being too goal oriented. Once a goal is reached, the same empty feeling will be back and you can start again. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.
