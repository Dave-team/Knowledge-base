# Self awareness
- I see many things as a race, such as reading a book. Life is not a race - it's about enjoying and taking in what I read at the present time 
- I have been a big content consumer lately and rather than actioning and using the learnings I've continued to consume. 
- I realize that we both don't really prioritize cleaning. Need to put more habits around this to avoid being unable to clean something later on. 
- One big thing I need to work on is my feeling of self confidence. I should be able to pitch myself easily and with confidence and portray things in such a way that I'm happy with my life
