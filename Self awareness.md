# Self awareness
## Principles
- Three questions to answer
    - Who am I?
    - What do I want out of life?
    - What do I value in life? 
- Keep good memories close to you 
- Have the ability to answer tough live questions. What’s you earliest childhood memory? Biggest failure? What are your parents like? Most emotional moment? Most happy/ proud moment? Etc.
- Find out about myself and be able to answer questions and tell interesting stories. Learn yourself better and know things about yourself you can say that are interesting
- Spend time reflecting what my ideal life looks like. How do I spend my weekdays, my weekends, who do I engage with and to which extend? Who knows me, how do I act around others. How do I think? What do I do when not at work or in a social setting? What do I value?  
- I’ve spent my early twenties searching for what I want to do and who I want to be. Life will continue to be a search but rather than forcefully searching, let's pause now and enjoy the present moments. And it’s about becoming better at where I am rather than contiueing to strive for somewhere I want to be. Focus on me as a person rather than an external goal that is beyond my own person. And the relationship has put me into this perspective - I was not able to love fully, I was always thinking, I was never happy to just relax as my monkey mind was always on
- I want to get to know myself and either be happy with who I am or change the things I am not happy about by getting after it. 

## Findings 
### Action on life rather than procrastinate by consuming content 
Rather than actually focusing on goals, hobbies and fighting my inner demons, I tend to consume content as a way of procrastination from the things I actually should be doing. I also have this Knowledge Base now that I keep improving and extending rather than fully using. The value lies in going deep in some content rather than always looking for something new - the FOMO is irrational as I likely already have most useful content directly in here and in a few fundamental books. The person I want to be and the life I want to live is not found by consuming content. 

### Set in my way
I am extremely set in my way: ‘what would you be if you weren’t X’. I’m so focused on my path that I forgot to think outside of it. Everything is just pretty practical  

### All or nothing thinking 
I tend to be in a place where I'm working on one thing entirely and then I struggle to maintain the balance with other things going on in life. E.g. I would either focus on mathematics/cooking and I couldn't really see myself balancing these things. 

Solution to this is probably: 
- What is the goal of learning mathematics / learning how to cook?
  - Learning how to cook = be able to make reciples comfortably
- What needs to be done to reach that goal? = cook new reciples
- What is the simplest first step that puts me in the right direction? = make 1 new recipe this weekend. Finding a recipe takes 10 minutes and it puts me on the path towards the goal. Then I hold myself accountable to these small goals/habits which will ultimately lead to reaching the goal
- Do that first step for 1 hour today and see how that goes. By blocking this time, you know that you will still have time for everything else in life. It's all about balancing different 'priorities' 

### Be more relaxed
Man’s greatest problems arise because he is unable to sit still by himself. I find it hard to do 'nothing' as in something that fundamentally isn't productive which is either work or learning. But these moments are often the best in life. And when I do something that isn't productive, I immediately want to optimise the process to finish as fast as possible - I focus on the 'goal' and stop enjoying the process. I want to finish a book rather than enjoying it - so I become anxious reading a book because I want to finish it - even though that is not the actual objective of reading. When doing something that doesn't feel productive, think about why this is a great thing: I am doing this to train my mind to be more relaxed which will positively affect relationships, work and general well-being. And e.g. in the case of fiction: I’m reading fiction as I’m trying to follow complex dialogue, learn new vocabulary and get a better understanding of humanity

Life is not a race - it's about enjoying things at the present time. Spend time reading a fiction book, do a puzzle, be engaged in conversation and most importantly, just sit down with my thoughts. Just do things for the sake of doing them rather than because they would help me in some way. If I prepare my brain correctly, that will be the most productive time - thinking about my goals and the person I want to be. 

To this point, I wanted to finish a book on CBT prior to the next team meeting so I couldn't blame myself for not having this context. This in itself is creating anxiety in mind. By not giving my mind the time to reflect on the things I'm learning, the effectivness also decreased dramatically. 

### Calm mind 
I’d like to have a more calm mind and more optimism and confidence that things will be okay. This is the biggest key to life. 

### Do the hard strategic work
I tend to default to asking someone else when a difficult or strategic piece of work needs to be decided on or implemented. Instead, to advance my career I should assume completely ownership myself - what would I do if I was the one deciding? 

### Be patient and tackle challenges with a positive attitube
I get annoyed when things don't go well - this in turn affects my mood. I want things to finish quickly and when something hinders me from doing that, and I can't figure it out, I get annoyed. To overcome this, I need to accept the challenge as a puzzle to be fixed and that is then my main priority. When something is hard, it means there are things to be learned and I will get better in the process. It's about staying relaxed and sometimes you need to sleep on the problem and then fix it in the morning. I cannot take these problems personally and I cannot be so affected by them. It might be that I get into work and 9 things are broken - trying to fix everything all the time will only lead to burnout. 

### The world isn't black and white
Realize that not everything is black and white / binary, there are multiple ways of doing things and not everyone is like me and I'm not always right. So rather than being defense against suggestions, accept other solutions too. Also, don't try to always bucket things - it's often not either/or - instead, seek a middle ground/compromise. When people share their concerns with me, be sure to listen - don't disregard it because you have a different opinion. Go deep into why they think that way and see if there is something that ought to be done. When people don't feel listened to and when they are genuinely worried about something and you don't action it - they will leave you.

Similarly, I often go into 'let me fix that' mode. Instead, don't give advice and only jump in when people specifically ask for your advice. 

### Lower the pressure on yourself
I tend to put really high pressure on myself constantly. Very high standards and never taking the easier way out. Sometimes, I should relax and just not take myself and life so seriously.  

### Don't overthink / think obsessively
I have a strong tendency to overthink things. This is split between: 
- overthinking about what might happen in the future (anxiety) 
- overthinking something that happened and I think about all different contexts related to that. 
- overthinking a most optimal way to do something 
- overthinking a decision to be made 
  
This overthinking makes me unable to focus my mind on anything other than the thing I'm overthinking. Most often, there are a few solutions to overthinking: 
- Talk to the person involved. Be honest about you're feelings and ask them questions. Instead of thinking what their motivations are, ask them as me thinking what they think won't get anywhere 
- The future is largely out of our control once we have done everything we can. Don't focus on things out of our control and bring the focus back to what we can control
- What is the easiest first step to do? Forget about planning the optimal way to do things, take the first step and be fine if things don't go exactly as planned. This type of overthinking is essentially procrastination
- Realize that problems aren't solved by thinking about them. So either action towards them or don't do anything at all. And when you forget about things, the subconscious mind might help coming up with the solution 
- Focus on the bigger picture - if you're working towards the grander goals in life, most small things become irrelevant and there is no need to overthink quite as much

Examples where overthinking is intense: 
- Deciding between taking a job during COVID (Guardian). I wasn't able to focus on doing anything else than constantly thinking about which path to take
- Why did someone breakup with me? 
- How should I go about getting a drivers lincese? After all that thinking, I still hadn't taken a lesson

The impact of overthinking: 
- It's hard to switch my mind. 
  - This will impact the relationships in my life as I can't provide full attention and support to friends/family/spouse. 
  - If I'm focused on my own problems during standup, I don't listen anymore to what others say. This would hinder me from being a great manager
- It's the opposite of having a calm mind that is required to be most effective
- It doesn't allow me to focus on the things I should be focused on 
- It is not helping me to make the most of my life

### Be aware of feelings and emotions and communicate them
I find it hard to understand my own feelings and find that I'm am often slightly out of touch with my feelings. Even when I do feel them, I often don't share them and just keep being closed. Any relationship is based on us understanding ourselves and sharing our feelings openly and honestly. 

### Social

#### 1-1s 
I feel fine. Usually, the conversation is in depth about a topic we both enjoy talking about 

#### Strangers 1-1
I am not the quickest to introduce myself or generally engage with new people. Having a genuine interest in them would benefit here. 

#### Larger group of friends / colleagues
I don't speak up much - probably to avoid having the attention on me. I am nervous when speaking in front of others - i.e. I get uncorfortable when the attention is on me. I also don't feel good about speaking about myself. I feel attacked / judged and tend to see comments as an attack on my value. My thinking: 
- If I say something: 
  - What would they think of me? Would they find me boring, uninteresting? 
  - What could their follow up question or comment be? I'm not sure I am willing/able to answer that question, especially if those questions are personal. Maybe I don't even know myself well enough to answer that question. 
  - They might discover who I really am - someone who is ultimately quite boring without hobbies except for personal development 
- When a questions is being asked to the group and I don't feel comfortable around it: 'What kind of animal are you?' I tend to just get stuck. These type of questions are very on the spot and I don't have the time to think about it. This goes in the way of me thinking that my answer should be 'perfect' and that makes me anxious and not willing to share. 
- I tend to think that I should remain quiet unless I have something to add. So if its not personal, I'd think that my contribution to whatever is being talked about would not be relevant or otherwise interesting. And otherwise, I might think that the topic discussed is not very interesting to me - this would be because of my narrow mindedness 
- If someone comments, I know that I'll take that personally and that is coming from a lack of self esteem as I'm not sure it's the right thing. 

Things to explore: 
- Be more convinced you're living the life you want to live (have higher self esteem in this regard). Be comfortable in my own skin first. If you're not confident about your life style (e.g. personal development, interesting things you do / have done and can add value to others), there are two options: 
  - Own it and be happy this way. This is what you like to do and others accept it or not 
  - Don't own it, realize that actually this isn't what life is about and change hobbies 
- When put on the spot: 
  - Don't feel obliged to answer: 'I'll get back to that' at work. 'I'd rather not say that as it makes me uncomfortable' in a personal session
  - There is no perfect answer - whatever comes up in that moment in the answer you go with instead. 

To realize: 
- We all have our issues and people will love and value and want to be with you for who you are. When you open up you allow others in your life. Being a closed box tends to move people away so be more open and vulnerable. 
- Good people/friends will not judge based on what you say. If they do, realize that you should perhaps expect it and then have the confidence to actually deal with it (perhaps visualize it in advance)
- It’s okay. Open your heart and trust the people around you. The things I say provide enough value for the company. Stop trying to be perfect and just say the things that come up without thinking whether it’s good enough. Just be you. If people don’t like it, it’s better to know that earlier rather than later. 
- Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Believe in yourself and in your life and interests. Don’t play that down just because you think others won’t approve. If that feels like the right thing for me, then own that and be comfortable in that. I probably know myself quite well and I’m hiding what I know because of the expectations of others and when I get feedback on what I said, that is taken as a personal attack very quickly or I feel as if people are bored. People will take me for whom I am and if they judge after me being myself, they’re not good friends. If I feel like I don’t have the answers, spend more time understanding myself
- I have spent almost my whole life– 31 years–   caring far too much about  offending people, worrying if I’m cool enough for them, or asking myself if they are judging me.
I can’t take it anymore. It’s stupid, and it’s not good for my well being.  It has made me a punching bag–   a flighty, nervous wuss. But worse than that, it has made me someone who doesn’t take a stand for anything. It has made me someone who stood in the middle, far too often, and not where I cared to stand, for fear of alienating others. No more. Not today.

To do: 
- Get used to being uncomfortable by seeking these situations: speak at any reasonable opportunity that presents itself
- Visualize yourself as someone who likes doing it. Great speakers love an opportunity to talk and present. Believe it or not but you can train yourself to be like that and it starts by pretending to yourself that you really want that opportunity to be in the lime light. Be hungry for it.
- Before the event, speak to as many people as possible to reduce the pressure.
- Put more priority and thought into being around other people and in the centre of attention. I never visualized it, I never prepared for it and then when it happens, I am lost. 
- Become the more well rounded person with hobbies, an understanding and opinion of many things that I can use as hooks in conversations. It'll also help in creative thought
- In social settings, have a calm mind which will allow me to think on my feet 
- Stop caring too much about what others think of me. There is only one person to please in life and that is myself. I need to live according to my own character. 
- Think more about own life and what is worth talking about and mentally prepare talking about these things 
- If this doesn't flow/work, realize its okay to realize I'm more queiet in social group settings 
- Self acceptance: relax and just be yourself and be happy with who you are 
- Come across as really interested and engaged. Give the impression to the room that you want to speak and to be heard. Speaking up works because the anxiety only gets worse if you sit there in total silence waiting to be called upon. Don’t wait for them to call you - speak out.

#### Work: team meetings 
I feel anxiety around presenting what I've done and what I'll be working on. There are probably three main reasons for this: 

1. There is some level of imposter syndrome. 
   1. Have I worked on the right things?
   2. Am I doing these things right? 
   3. Have I worked hard enough?
2. I am afraid I'm not meeting the expectations of others. I tend to want to please people and when I don't 100% believe I've done things perfectly (to the expectations of others), I feel like a slight let down to the other people, which in my mind would lead them to think I'm either incompetent to work on the right things in a smart way or that I'm simply not working hard enough. I am afraid that what I'm working on is not to the approval of others. 
3. I am afraid of being nervous - causing me to be even more nervous. And I probably don't necessarily mind being nervous but I'm nervous that my nervousness caused me to tremble and not speak with the level of clarity and confidence I would like. 

Tips: 
- Own your job, know deep down that I'm doing the right things and then be happy to present. 
- Take myself out of the equation and I’m bringing value to the company. What I say doesn't matter - did the work get done? That's what matters and I just communicate that. Right now, I believe that me as a person am directly linked to my job. 
- I represent my own brand and want to provide value and impact at all times. Being able to public speak or communicate is essential for this. If I feel anxious because I feel like I didn't do enough - work harder. 
- Realize that I portray the approval of others - I portray what they may think and it might also be me telling myself I'm doing the wrong things. But that belief is what I'm telling myself, it is not real. Unless I believe I am doing the right things, nobody else will believe it. And this confidence is extremely crucial to get ahead in life / career. 
- After every presentation, realize that it didn't matter as much and people didn't actually care that much. 
- If I can engage in the discussions early on, my nerves should slowly move away as a connection has been built with e.g. the audience. 

Other tips: 
- Make sure to also slow down during these meetings to allow others to jump in. 
- Write my notes on paper rather than digital
- Don't prepare to the point of memorizing 

#### Work: non team meetings 
I don't speak up in meetings much as I am afraid of asking stupid questions, give obvious recommendations. I am 'just' the data person - everyone know surely would already have thought of what I'm thinking? Who am I to have an opinion here? 

### Judging
- When I see people, I judge: e.g. fat/skinny
- When someone does something I don't really agree with, I judge: this is good/this is bad. And often I then portray that to myself and put a value judgement on it. But often this is like: I don't / wouldn't ever do this, so I value this as bad which of course doesn't really make sense as people live by their own values and they likely differ from my values. 
- Why do I judge others? I judge because I think black and white. I have a fixed path in my mind of what everyone should be like so when someone is different, I consider that bad . I need to open my heart and just love

### Relationship findings
- I fear being rejected - particularly feeling as if I'm not good enough which hits my self esteem. If I am confident enough, I don't care when one person rejects me - there are many others who are happy to be with me. And even if not, I am happy with my independent life. The goal here is to be outcome independent 
- I fear losing those I love. People die, people change. Losing those we love is a major part of life that everyone needs to deal with. 
- I tend to see the positives only. When I'm comfortable and relatively happy it's hard for me to see negatives. Instead, have regular critical check-ins with yourself and ask yourself how it's going and where it's going. And don't fall in the trap of loving someone just because they love you and that feels good. Value yourself more than that. 
- I am a people pleaser and probably wouldn't quickly reject/break up with someone purely out of fear. Instead, realise this is your one life - know what you want out of it. If something doesn't sit right, become aware of it. Then communicate it. Then fix it. If it can't be fixed, you need to be strong for the both of you to break things of now rather than waiting any longer. You both deserve better. 
- I am anxious about the future - will I be able to get a new SO when I have been single for so long? Instead, approach life with curiosity - who knows what will happen? Just be happy - then you won't need anyone else.
- I tend to become dependant and complacent during a relationship. Instead, keep living my own life, chase my goals and keep my social cirlce and hobbies. And beyond that, invest in the relationship if it's worthwhile: initiate things, show that you care, communicate honestly, etc.
- I fear being lonely. Don't be lonely - fill your life with purpose, family, friends, hobbies  
- I fear making the wrong decisions - we often make only a few major decisions in our lives and I fear regretting the decision. Decisions are not forever. Give things a chance when it feels right, be in touch with feelings and if it turns out to have been the wrong decision, be strong enough to end things. 
- I crave a strong sense of belonging and validation. I want someone to care about me and I want to know that someone will reply and just be there for me. I want to feel loved and this validation made me feel good about myself; if I don't feel loved this hits my self esteem and makes me not feel good about myself. Seeking external validation from someone you don't fundamentally control is not good. Enjoy it when you have it but be aware that you can't rely on validation that isn't coming from within. 
- At times I felt like my worth was determined by whether I was in a relationship or not. Being with someone is what I’d consider a successful life whereas being single is a sign that my life isn’t complete. This has been amplified by e.g. how family approaches us. Instead, be entirely happy independently first. 

### Flying
Tons of flights happen. The pilots wouldn’t fly if there was an issue. Turbulence is just a bumpy road. Try to comfort yourself. Realise it’s okay to feel that way because you’re not in control. But it happens often and the pilots are the right people to take care of it. Statistically, were incredibly safe. Learn about planes. You’re not in control any more so just let it happen

### Privileged
Extremely lucky being white male and grew up in Netherlands. Worst thing that can happen isn’t that bad - could always go back to Netherlands

### Minimalism
I know that watches (or any materialistic things for that matter) ultimately won't bring happiness. They are a risk to keep for theft or damage, they need to be serviced, the search for watches is time consuming that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere. It's a constant race to reach the next thing. I'm also keen to keep as little things as possible in my life avoid clutter.   

### Build personality
- So far, my lifestyle has been very square with very few extremely crazy things. To break out of that, I need to do more wild things and spice up my life. 
- Focus less on doing only things that make sense for my development or only finding the 'best' ways to do things. Do things more just for the sake of doing them and don't put so many rules and boundaries.
- Get rid of the checklist mentally and be more freeriding through life 
- Avoid living a life that is textbook 'this is how you should life'. Instead, try some things that non standard 
- Avoid being too goal oriented. Once a goal is reached, the same empty feeling will be back and you can start again. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.
