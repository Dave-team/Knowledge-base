# Self awareness
## Principles
- Three questions to answer
    - Who am I?
    - What do I want out of life?
    - What do I value in life? 
- Keep good memories close to you 
- Have the ability to answer tough live questions. What’s you earliest childhood memory? Biggest failure? What are your parents like? Most emotional moment? Most happy/ proud moment? Etc.
- Find out about myself and be able to answer questions and tell interesting stories. Learn yourself better and know things about yourself you can say that are interesting
- Spend time reflecting what my ideal life looks like. How do I spend my weekdays, my weekends, who do I engage with and to which extend? Who knows me, how do I act around others. How do I think? What do I do when not at work or in a social setting? What do I value?  

## Findings 
### Action on life rather than procrastinate by consuming content 
Rather than actually focusing on goals and hobbies, I tend to consume content as a way of procrastination from the things I actually should be doing. I also have this Knowledge Base now that I keep improving and extending rather than fully using. The value lies in going deep in some content rather than always looking for something new - the FOMO is irrational as I likely already have most useful content directly in here and in a few fundamental books. The person I want to be and the life I want to live is not found by consuming content. 

### Be more relaxed
Man’s greatest problems arise because he is unable to sit still by himself. I find it hard to do 'nothing' as in something that fundamentally isn't productive which is either work or learning. But these moments are often the best in life. And when I do something that isn't productive, I immediately want to optimise the process to finish as fast as possible - I focus on the 'goal' and stop enjoying the process. I want to finish a book rather than enjoying it - so I become anxious reading a book because I want to finish it - even though that is not the actual objective of reading. When doing something that doesn't feel productive, think about why this is a great thing: I am doing this to train my mind to be more relaxed which will positively affect relationships, work and general well-being. And e.g. in the case of fiction: I’m reading fiction as I’m trying to follow complex dialogue, learn new vocabulary and get a better understanding of humanity

Life is not a race - it's about enjoying things at the present time. Spend time reading a fiction book, do a puzzle, be engaged in conversation and most importantly, just sit down with my thoughts. Just do things for the sake of doing them rather than because they would help me in some way. If I prepare my brain correctly, that will be the most productive time - thinking about my goals and the person I want to be. 

### Calm mind 
I’d like to have a more calm mind and more optimism and confidence that things will be okay. This is the biggest key to life. 

### Do the hard strategic work
I tend to default to asking someone else when a difficult or strategic piece of work needs to be decided on or implemented. Instead, to advance my career I should assume completely ownership myself - what would I do if I was the one deciding? 

### Be patient and tackle challenges with a positive attitube
I get annoyed when things don't go well - this in turn affects my mood. I want things to finish quickly and when something hinders me from doing that, and I can't figure it out, I get annoyed. To overcome this, I need to accept the challenge as a puzzle to be fixed and that is then my main priority. When something is hard, it means there are things to be learned and I will get better in the process. It's about staying relaxed and sometimes you need to sleep on the problem and then fix it in the morning. 

### The world isn't black and white
Realize that not everything is black and white / binary, there are multiple ways of doing things and not everyone is like me and I'm not always right. So rather than being defense against suggestions, accept other solutions too. Also, don't try to always bucket things - it's often not either/or - instead, seek a middle ground/compromise. When people share their concerns with me, be sure to listen - don't disregard it because you have a different opinion. Go deep into why they think that way and see if there is something that ought to be done. When people don't feel listened to and when they are genuinely worried about something and you don't action it - they will leave you.

Similarly, I often go into 'let me fix that' mode. Instead, don't give advice and only jump in when people specifically ask for your advice. 

### Anxiety during work meetings
I can be nervous to present around what I have been working on. There are probably two main reasons for this: 

1. There is some level of imposter syndrome. Am I doing the right thing and am I doing that thing right? 
2. I am afraid I'm not meeting the expectations of others. I'm afraid that what they hear I do and achieve is not in line with their expectations (large progress on major milestones) and in my mind this would lead them to think I'm either incompetent to work on the right things in a smart way or that I'm simply not working hard enough. This is entirely me portraying what they may think and it might also be me telling myself I'm doing the wrong things. Unless I believe I am doing the right things, nobody else will believe it.  

Another observation is that this pressure was at Elevate and now at Papier and it's because I'm talking about what I'm doing with people who aren't involved with what I'm doing. It was George and Jon at Elevate and now its Anthony at Papier. I'm always fine presenting to the team and the manager, probably just because I know them a lot better. 

I'm short, you have a belief that if you talk to your boss and he doesn't approve of what you say , he will view you as some sort of failure, or not look at you in a positive way.
This belief causes the fear you experience without you realizing it.
The good news is that it's pretty easy to get rid of this belief once you recognize it! The main thing you need to remind yourself is that this belief is not real. It doesn't exist at all in reality, it's simply something you (falsely) tell your self is true.

### Lower the pressure on yourself
I tend to put really high pressure on myself constantly. Very high standards and never taking the easier way out. Sometimes, I should relax and just not take myself and life so seriously.  

### Don't overthink / think obsessively
I have a strong tendency to overthink things. This is split between: 
- overthinking about what might happen in the future (anxiety) 
- overthinking something that happened and I think about all different contexts related to that. 
- overthinking a most optimal way to do something 
- overthinking a decision to be made 
  
This overthinking makes me unable to focus my mind on anything other than the thing I'm overthinking. Most often, there are a few solutions to overthinking: 
- Talk to the person involved. Be honest about you're feelings and ask them questions. Instead of thinking what their motivations are, ask them as me thinking what they think won't get anywhere 
- The future is largely out of our control once we have done everything we can. Don't focus on things out of our control and bring the focus back to what we can control
- What is the easiest first step to do? Forget about planning the optimal way to do things, take the first step and be fine if things don't go exactly as planned. This type of overthinking is essentially procrastination
- Realize that problems aren't solved by thinking about them. So either action towards them or don't do anything at all. And when you forget about things, the subconscious mind might help coming up with the solution 
- Focus on the bigger picture - if you're working towards the grander goals in life, most small things become irrelevant and there is no need to overthink quite as much

Examples where overthinking is intense: 
- Deciding between taking a job during COVID (Guardian). I wasn't able to focus on doing anything else than constantly thinking about which path to take
- Why did someone breakup with me? 
- How should I go about getting a drivers lincese? After all that thinking, I still hadn't taken a lesson

The impact of overthinking: 
- It's hard to switch my mind. 
  - This will impact the relationships in my life as I can't provide full attention and support to friends/family/spouse. 
  - If I'm focused on my own problems during standup, I don't listen anymore to what others say. This would hinder me from being a great manager
- It's the opposite of having a calm mind that is required to be most effective
- It doesn't allow me to focus on the things I should be focused on 
- It is not helping me to make the most of my life

### Be aware of feelings and emotions and communicate them
I find it hard to understand my own feelings and find that I'm am often slightly out of touch with my feelings. Even when I do feel them, I often don't share them and just keep being closed. Any relationship is based on us understanding ourselves and sharing our feelings openly and honestly. 

### Social
- I am nervous when speaking in front of others - i.e. I get uncorfortable when the attention is on me. Get used to being uncomfortable by seeking these situations and visualize yourself as someone who likes doing it. 
- I'm not the biggest fan of speaking about myself. Often, group conversations are about sharing personal stories and I'm not the biggest fan of that. Other than personal stories, a big part of group conversations is on the spot spontaneous comments and I also need to work on that as my creative out of the box thinking is currently limited. As a consequence I'm often quiet in group conversations. In 1-1 talks, there is often a more purposeful topic so I'm fine. To do: 
    - Improve creative thought
    - Think more about own life and what is worth talking about and mentally prepare talking about these things 
    - If this doesn't flow/work, realize its okay to realize I'm more queiet in social group settings 
- I sometimes feel like missing out on life experiences such as weddings because of a limited social circle. 
- This might be related to social anxiety I may have and it would tie in with the anxiety I have around presenting what I've been working on to different people. I am someone who wants to please people and when I don't 100% believe I've been working on the right things, I feel like a slight let down to the other people. Need to realize that either I fucked up and own up to that and then that's fine. Or there are too many things on my plate and we need simply need to shift priorities  

### Relationship findings
- I fear being rejected - particularly feeling as if I'm not good enough which hits my self esteem. If I am confident enough, I don't care when one person rejects me - there are many others who are happy to be with me. And even if not, I am happy with my independent life. The goal here is to be outcome independent 
- I fear losing those I love. People die, people change. Losing those we love is a major part of life that everyone needs to deal with. 
- I tend to see the positives only. When I'm comfortable and relatively happy it's hard for me to see negatives. Instead, have regular critical check-ins with yourself and ask yourself how it's going and where it's going. And don't fall in the trap of loving someone just because they love you and that feels good. Value yourself more than that. 
- I am a people pleaser and probably wouldn't quickly reject/break up with someone purely out of fear. Instead, realise this is your one life - know what you want out of it. If something doesn't sit right, become aware of it. Then communicate it. Then fix it. If it can't be fixed, you need to be strong for the both of you to break things of now rather than waiting any longer. You both deserve better. 
- I am anxious about the future - will I be able to get a new SO when I have been single for so long? Instead, approach life with curiosity - who knows what will happen? Just be happy - then you won't need anyone else.
- I tend to become dependant and complacent during a relationship. Instead, keep living my own life, chase my goals and keep my social cirlce and hobbies. And beyond that, invest in the relationship if it's worthwhile: initiate things, show that you care, communicate honestly, etc.
- I fear being lonely. Don't be lonely - fill your life with purpose, family, friends, hobbies  
- I fear making the wrong decisions - we often make only a few major decisions in our lives and I fear regretting the decision. Decisions are not forever. Give things a chance when it feels right, be in touch with feelings and if it turns out to have been the wrong decision, be strong enough to end things. 
- I crave a strong sense of belonging and validation. I want someone to care about me and I want to know that someone will reply and just be there for me. I want to feel loved and this validation made me feel good about myself; if I don't feel loved this hits my self esteem and makes me not feel good about myself. Seeking external validation from someone you don't fundamentally control is not good. Enjoy it when you have it but be aware that you can't rely on validation that isn't coming from within. 
- At times I felt like my worth was determined by whether I was in a relationship or not. Being with someone is what I’d consider a successful life whereas being single is a sign that my life isn’t complete. This has been amplified by e.g. how family approaches us. Instead, be entirely happy independently first. 

### Flying
Tons of flights happen. The pilots wouldn’t fly if there was an issue. Turbulence is just a bumpy road. Try to comfort yourself. Realise it’s okay to feel that way because you’re not in control. But it happens often and the pilots are the right people to take care of it. Statistically, were incredibly safe. Learn about planes. You’re not in control any more so just let it happen

### Privileged
Extremely lucky being white male and grew up in Netherlands. Worst thing that can happen isn’t that bad - could always go back to Netherlands

### Minimalism
I know that watches (or any materialistic things for that matter) ultimately won't bring happiness. They are a risk to keep for theft or damage, they need to be serviced, the search for watches is time consuming that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere. It's a constant race to reach the next thing. I'm also keen to keep as little things as possible in my life avoid clutter.   

### Build personality
- So far, my lifestyle has been very square with very few extremely crazy things. To break out of that, I need to do more wild things and spice up my life. 
- Focus less on doing only things that make sense for my development or only finding the 'best' ways to do things. Do things more just for the sake of doing them and don't put so many rules and boundaries.
- Get rid of the checklist mentally and be more freeriding through life 
- Avoid living a life that is textbook 'this is how you should life'. Instead, try some things that non standard 
- Avoid being too goal oriented. Once a goal is reached, the same empty feeling will be back and you can start again. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.
