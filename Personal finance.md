# Personal finance

## Principles
- Reduce expenses as much as possible. If need be, track expenses in a budget
- Only spend a lot of money on worthwhile things (see below)
- Ideally, find ways to generate passive income
- Pay yourself first: make sure to allocate assets when money comes in before using the money to spend on other things
- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
- Make sure to make full use of the ISA allowance of £20,000 annualy to avoid paying tax on investments
- Invest in a global equity fund for the long term - remember compound interest
