# Product Management 
## General
Product Management is the art of solving your customer’s problems to reach your business objectives. 
Think about ideas: what makes a good product and what can be improved and what problem can we solve? 

## Product Opportunity Assessment
- Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)
- For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)
- How big is the opportunity? (market size)
- What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)
- Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)
- Why now? (market window)
- How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)
- How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)
- What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)
- Given the above, what’s the recommendation? (go or no-go)

## Product development process
Build products by working around hypothesis. Create something minimal to validate hypothesis – get feedback and iterate. Very much the MVP principle – get the product in front of users early and often. Users will want features – your job is to understand why they want those features and then build a solution to the problem – which might not be the mentioned feature. People need to go mad about the idea. If it’s not a HELL YES! Then don’t push it. Think of your product in terms of stages: start by building version 0.1. The end goal is version 8.5, but you get there incrementally   

Essentials of building a product:
- A product succeeds because it solves a problem for people
- The first step when building something new is understanding what problem you are solving and for whom
- The second question is to ask: why is this particular problem worth solving?
- Go after a problem for a narrowly defined audience
- Brainstorm solutions and prioritize based on common sense and based on some high fidelity prototypes you gauge feedback on. Go broad before going deep. 
- With a solution picked, frame it into hypotheses. 
- Test your hypothesis as quickly as possible and know how you measure and define success. In larger organizations, this is done by allowing customers to ‘opt in’ to testing products 
- Iterate 
- Test usability, desirability and feasibility before proceeding to engineering
- Do a post mortem after every project

Example: create a product that allows restaurants owners to create an app simply:
- Create a mock-up of such an app 
- Go around restaurants and ask what their problems are with technology. Do they have an app? Why not? Do they want one? How tech savvy are they? Do they understand the benefits and is it something they actual realize the would need? Key is to either have them use your product or try to understand how they currently solve the problem – this will indicate a need as well. Avoid them being too nice – let them rank things or give them examples of negative feedback you received from others 
- You might find that they are not into apps, but want a simple website. 
- Next step, ask again:
  - What is my riskiest assumption? Whether they’d be willing to pay for such a website. 
  - Quickest experiment: MVP could be a static website, bring it to the owners – do they like it? Is this basic version enough and would they be willing to pay if handed over now? 
- Next steps, ask again:
  - What is my riskiest assumption? Which marketing channels work
  - Minimal test: create a landing page: description of product, case studies of websites, email address form for getting more info on the launch of the business (or just generally getting more info). Then, spend £100 in various channels and see what works best. 

## Prototypes
There are four types of prototypes:
1. Feasibility prototypes: written by engineers to address technical risks during product discovery before we decide whether something is feasible or not
2. Low fidelity user prototypes: an interactive wireframe that at this stage but isn’t real (e.g. you can enter card details but you won’t pay for anything). Tool can be Balsamic and usually it’s created by interaction designers. They represent information and workflow
3. High fidelity user prototypes: Now things are more real, but the outcome set is limited. E.g. you always get the same results when you search for something. 
4. Live- data prototypes: this stage is where you can actually really prove something. Its where you use real data (e.g. stock) and bring real traffic to the product. This is the ultimate MVP

## Personas
- Archetype description of imaginary but very plausible user of product (focused on behaviours, attitude and goals)
- They need to be defined by interviewing customers
- It helps understanding who exactly your customers are, why they use your product
- When it comes to prioritization of projects, you essentially build something for a few personas. 
- It ensures that employees don’t think like their customers – after all, we interviewed them and wrote up how they think etc. 

## Idea generation
- Focus on getting many ideas. Get a good idea by first getting many bad ideas
- Think about starting projects, not companies
- Think of problems/annoyances you have in your life. Write them down
- Pay attention to the ideas that keep coming back to you 
- Talk to others about what you’re doing 
- The best way to come up with ideas is to ask: what do you wish someone would make for you? 
- Two types of startup ideas: 
  - Those that grow organically out of own life. What is something missing or broken in your daily life? You may need to get outside yourself – as we tend to get used to broken things and take them for granted. 
  - Those that you decide, from afar, are going to be necessary to some class of people other than you. This takes a lot of experience to judge on. Therefore, start with organic especially early on in career 
- A good way to come up with ideas is just to sit down and think. Let things flow
- Procrastination is another great way of getting many ideas. It leaves for more opportunity for things to go into your subconscious mind
- To get good ideas, get lots of shitty ideas first

## PM documents
When building a new product, you generally have two documents: a product requirements document (PRD) and a product spec. 

**PRD**
- Purpose and scope, from both a technical and business perspective
- Stakeholder identification
- Market assessment and target demographics
- Product overview and use cases
- Requirements, including:
  - functional requirements (e.g. what a product should do)
  - usability requirements
  - technical requirements (e.g. security, network, platform, integration, client)
  - environmental requirements
  - support requirements
  - interaction requirements (e.g. how the product should work with other systems)
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Dependencies
- High level workflow plans, timelines and milestones (more detail is defined through a project plan)
- Evaluation plan and performance metrics

**Product spec**
From the PRD, a Spec is set up, where the spec specifies the technical specifications of the product in more detail. A Product Spec contains: 
1. The Problem. Frame the problem that you trying to solve. More importantly, explain why it is worth addressing. Be specific, and provide metrics.
2. Measurable Goals. Promise clear deliverables and outcomes. Identify what’s out of scope. Make sure it’s easy to look at each goal and answer: did we hit it?
3. Context. Provide evidence that your audience needs to understand the problem and believe in your proposal. Assumptions, use-cases, metrics, etc.
4. Detailed Solution. Your proposal should be detailed enough for your team to consume and execute — think of it like code for human brains to run
5. Timeline. List dates and milestones that your team believes in. This section may start off vague, but should be finalized in your last spec review.
