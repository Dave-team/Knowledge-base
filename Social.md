# Social

## Principles
- Start by having a deep and intense desire to increase your ability to deal with people. Do this by reminding yourself how much richer and better your life will be if you’re able to properly deal with the people around you. 
- It’s something that takes work: you can’t just be passive. Instead, force yourself to be in social settings, face yourself to say things and take initiative. If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for others. Things that require time, energy, unselfishness  and thoughtfulness.
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. People are unique and we all have stories to tell. Focus on finding out about their story: focus on their past experiences, their hobbies, their ambitions and their feelings and emotions and motivations. 
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them.   
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- A human touch often goes a very long way, don’t be afraid to touch. Especially when meeting someone and saying goodbye: shake hands, hug, kiss 
- A social interaction takes preparation:  consider who you want to talk about, what you’d and the other person would likely want to talk about  
- Don’t judge people. Don’t criticize, condemn or complain. Don’t criticize or judge people: ‘they are just what we would be under similar circumstances’. ‘Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain and most fools do but it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men. Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. 
- Be kind
- Consider the other person's point of view. There is a reason behave and are the way they are. Figure that out 
- When going to a social event, make it worthwhile or don't go at all 
- Thank people for the impact they’ve had on your life: teachers, early managers. Track them down and write a genuine note
- Remember peoples names and make you note when you find out their name. Then study to not forget
- Everybody is either a potential friend or we can help one another out in some way 
- Be enthusiastic, show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me. Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose
- Realize that everyone has issues, good/bad experiences, dealt with shitty jobs, break-ups, good and bad times and together we make things just a bit better
- Send more random things to friends. It’s not always about catching up and meeting. It’s about being top of mind and regular contact. Send them things they also like and give them things of value
- A most effective way of developing an attractive personality in being able to stand on your feet and speak convincingly. Put feeling and emotion into your words as you speak and develop a deep, rich tone of voice. Also be interested in people and give praise. 
- Give honest and sincere appreciation. Appreciate people for who they are. Therefore, focus on the positive. It should be a goal to show appreciation throughout everything. If a meal was good, give compliments. If the service was good, mention it. Show appreciation and gratitude.   
- In addition to being grateful for the positives in our lives, another way to activate and support our new positive core beliefs is to do kind things for other people. Examples include opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend, smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs
- People like others who are like themselves. 
- People love talking about themselves.
- People don't care about the things you said but about how you made them feel. So make people feel good about themselves. Create strong positive associations – focus on what is right and what is good about other people. When given a compliment, stop, absorb and pause, show thankfulness on your face. Say: thank you very much
- We remember visuals better than words. Try to speak in pictures and try to engage as many of the 5 senses as possible. 
- Remember that when you’re speaking to someone, you are taking their time and attention. Make sure to be worth it and give them value back. Give them: entertainment, information or good feelings. Aim to bring high value for low effort 
- In your interactions with others, try to mimic their body language to enhance trust and rapport. 
- The more authentic and genuine we are, especially around personal experiences and even self doubt, the more people can relate and the safer it is for them to express themselves. 
- If someone sees something different, ask them to clarify how they see the situation
- Smile - it shows warmth. A smile says: I am happy to see you, I like you and you make me happy. This is invaluable. You can’t expect people to come to you. You have to go out and meet them. 
- Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. 
- Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately. When talking with people, make sure to start emphasizing things on which you agree, not the points on which you differ.

## 1-1 Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
    - Flow in conversation: give an invitation to speak = ask an interesting question. Give inspiration to speak = tell something interesting yourself
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 
- Always be prepared to answer the ‘what about you?’ question

## Group conversations 
- Realize that group conversations are about shallow, fun conversation rather than sharing information. Stupid things are being said, laughed at and nobody cares.  
- People want you to be open. They want to know you, trust and feel comfortable around sharing things themselves. By not sharing yours, people don't feel good sharing about their lives as they might think I judge them. 
- You want to engage because you could make friends. If you're closed and invicible, people wouldn't want to know more / invite you to activities etc.  
- Once you are, good friends will accept you and take you in their lives. If the judge based on what I say, they'll never end up being good friends anyway. 
- Put more priority and thought into being around other people and in the centre of attention. I never visualized it, I never prepared for it and then when it happens, I am lost. Also, spend more time thinking of things I can/want to speak about in conversations
- Become the more well rounded person with hobbies, an understanding and opinion of many things that I can use as hooks in conversations. It'll also help in creative thought. Get rid of my narrow horizon
- In social settings, have a calm mind which will allow me to think on my feet 
- Engage in some way from the start to reduce anxiety. Give the impression you're engaged - mind your body language. This will ensure others engage with you as they will see when you're not comfortable. 
- Speak to the person next to you / Focus on one person at a time - no need to always address the entire group 
- When put on the spot: don't feel obliged to answer: 'I'll get back to that' at work. 'I'd rather not say that as it makes me uncomfortable' in a personal session
- How to be vulnerable in conversations: 
  - Realize we all have our issues 
  - There is no perfect answer - whatever comes up in that moment in the answer you go with instead. It's ok and what I say is good enough - just be myself. Once you have something to say, don't hesitate. The moment you start questioning whether or not what you have to say is worthy it will be to late and the topic will change. Speak for the sake of speaking
  - Don't be too much in your own head thinking about my performance in the setting. Let go of the feeling that I need to speak. Just accept things as they are. Stop trying and stop worrying - it'll not help performance and it will decrease happiness. As long as youfocuses on themselves, they really can't contribute anything of substance to a group, and hence you don't get the attention. 
  - Trust the people around you and allow your heart to open and be vulnerable 
  - Don't care as much about how they may interpret or judge what I say 

- Visualize yourself as being someone who loves being right in the centre of attention because everybody is keep on listening to you and understand what it is you have to say. Be more influential and funny 

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Remembering names
Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 
- Concentrate your attention to it. E.g. when someone introduces themselves, concentrate your attention on the introduction and the person’s name. Repeat a few times what you want to remember  
- Use the person's name occasionally during the conversation
- Associate the name with something else. E.g. associate it with a friend who made the introduction 
- Repeat what you wish to remember whilst concentrating on it. 

## Friendships 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it - understand them instead. Just be there for them. Instead: that must be horrible. It reminds me of when (vulnerable, how did it make you feel and make sound smaller than their issue). Then: what are you doing about it?
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Friendships are about being there for others but most defintely also about allowing others to be there for us. Be open to receive the love
- Great friendships could come from couple friends

## Accept others
- Rather than being defensive against suggestions, accept other solutions too. 
- Also, don't try to always bucket things - it's often not either/or - instead, seek a middle ground/compromise.
- When people share their concerns with me, be sure to listen - don't disregard it because you have a different opinion. Go deep into why they think that way and see if there is something that ought to be done. 
- Don't give unsolicited advice and don't jump into 'let me fix that' mode. Far too often, we project our own experiences onto others expecting the situation to be the same. 
- But often this is like: I don't / wouldn't ever do this, so I value this as bad which of course doesn't really make sense as people live by their own values and they likely differ from my values. 

## First impression 
- Dress the part
- A good handshake. Hand straight, ensure hand palm contact, wrap hand then lock thumb down squeeze as much as the other. Finally shake from the elbow for 3 times and step back. 
- When exiting a conversation, try to give them something of value and then say it was a pleasure meeting you and move on. 

## Listening 
- Cornerstone to this is being present. Good listeners never interrupt – they just wait and remember what they want to say next. Allow others to interrupts you – the point is to make others feel right. 
- Rephrase what they said
- Reflect feeling. Reflect to them how they’re feeling. ‘I’m done with school!’ > ‘You’re frustrated’
- Encourage people to talk about themselves. 
- Very often when someone says something, we focus on having a judgement on that, rather than really understanding something. We should spend more time instead trying to really understand what the meaning of the statement is to the other person  
- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Focus on asking questions and let the other party do most of the talking. Don’t interrupt once you e.g. disagree with something they said. Instead, let them talk themselves out. Listen patiently and with the open mind. Encourage them to express themselves fully. 
- When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions; you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.
- Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion.
- Immediately into a conclusion and a label and this is how it is. Instead take time to explore and ask questions


## Charisma 
It's about presence, power and warmth:
- When you meet someone charismatic, you’ll feel that they hold enough power to move mountains for you and that they like you a lot. Power means being perceived as being able to affect the world around us. This is about making others feel inspired, make them believe. Warmth is goodwill towards others
- Someone who is charismatic will be reported as being extremely present – all they care about is the person or group they are engaging with. Make sure other peoples opinions are valued and that the people are important or at least feel that way. Make them feel welcomed and accepted. To be more present, practice meditation. In a conversation, ask yourself whether you are present. If not, focus on breath for a few seconds and then back to the person 


Other tips: 
- Visualize being charismatic
- Pretend you are who you want to be
- Body language is key. Make very few movements - the lion doesn't fidget. Make sure to not nod too often, don’t use too much verbal reassurance (uh-huh etc), don’t fidget. Get comfortable with silence and stillness 
- Warmth by becoming grateful and appreciate things, especially about the little things in life. 
- Goodwill and compassion: make people feel like they’re the only people in the world. Goodwill is the simple state of wishing others well. Start by thinking of 3 things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill about. Also, think ‘I like you’ when you see someone. 
- Compassion is empathy (understanding how someone feels) plus goodwill (wishing them well). Build compassion for someone by imagining their past (what would it have been like to grow up under their circumstances? Under the same circumstances, I might have turned out the same) Imagine their present – place yourself in their shoes now and imagine all the feelings they might have 
- Self compassion: this is the things you do when you have a hard time. Also, think about someone you admire and who is warm and compassionate. Think through their eyes telling you that you are absolutely perfect at this stage in your life. It can also be enhanced using photos that make you feel warm or e.g. quotes of others
