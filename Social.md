# Social

## Principles
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. A good connection contains emotions and motivations - they should feel as if I can bring value to them
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them.   
- Give without expecting anything in return 

## Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Friendships and relationships
- A good relationship is about being there for them when they need us. Be understanding and let them share their emotions. A good relationship is bonding on an emotional level. The ideal is when you are part of the other person reaching their goals 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it.
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Every relationship is voluntary - everyone is free to decide as they please and values change
- Aim for a happy independent life 
- Avoid complacency by not taking anything for granted
- Be honest and share how you feel
- The only thing we control is our contribution to the relationship. Keep working on making things better
- Seperate work issues from any relationship - be in the moment 
- Aim to do lots of fun things that you both enjoy doing. Aim to invite others too 
- Speak the right love language and keep the emotional love tank filled at all times 
- Set aside time to work on the relationship:
    - What we like
    - What we don’t like
    - What we’d like to see more of 
- Gifts: 
    - The gesture matters - it's about showing love and appreciation
    - Ideas could always be around experiences and something personal or handmade
    - Keep a running log of things they'd like to have
