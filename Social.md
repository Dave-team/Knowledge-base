# Social

## Interaction principles
- Goal is to learn about the other person and find common interests you can talk about
- A human touch often goes a very long way, so don’t be afraid to touch. Especially when meeting someone and saying goodbye: shake hands, hug, kiss.  
- The start and ending of an interaction is often key - 'Great to see you - you look good!' and then 'It was great seeing you - let's do it again soon'! 
- Use people's names during interactions. 
- Send more random things to friends. It’s not always about catching up and meeting. It’s about being top of mind and regular contact. Send them things they also like and give them things of value
- Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose
- People don't care about what you say but they'll remember how you make them feel: 
  - When interacting, speak convincingly, articulate well, speak with volume, confidently and with a good deep voice. 
  - Make them feel good about themselves 
  - Try to engage all their senses when speaking / we remember visuals better than words. 
- When giving a compliment, be specific and sincere. Stop, absorb and pause, show thankfulness on your face. Say: thank you very much
- Practice in daily life: 
  - If a meal was good, give compliments. 
  - If the service was good, mention it.
- Focus on having an open, relaxed body lanuage. 
- The best way to get into a flow state? Have multiple conversations throughout your day

## Conversations
**Preparation**
- Prepare answers to questions that always come up in social interactions
  - How am I?
  - How is my day going / how was my day? 
  - How was my weekend?
  - Do I have any plans for the next weekend? 
  - Have I been up to anything exciting? 
- Prepare this list of openers before social interactions so it's easier to remember and to put myself in the right mood. Remember that it takes work to become better at this.
- Who are you likely to meet today? Spend some time thinking about anything specific you want to say/ask. Ideally something happening in their lives or shared interests to catch up on. 
- If I have lots going on in life, I will naturally have more to share. So get out there doing stuff. 
- Once I have an opinion about things - I can share them. So be curious about lots of topics, the news, dive deeper into things, collect facts and build opinions to share and discuss.  
- Prepare stories to tell. What did I experience? What am I up to? Then prepare a story around the topic
- One way to invoke my own stories is to look at ice breakers, table questions, conversations starters and practice answering them in my head. 

**Random chit chat with colleagues**
- Comment on the context
  - "How did you like lunch"? "Did you try the chocolates?"
  - "Are you joining to the pub / party"?
  - "Are you excited about the Brand launch?"
  - Mention generic things happening in the world: “Are you going to watch the game tonight?” "Did you hear about event X in the news?"
- How are you?
- How was your weekend?
- Do you have any plans next weekend? 
- Give a compliment on something - “I really like those sneakers, what are they?"
- What are you working on? / How is project X going? 

**Moving a conversation along**
- Be aware and listen during the conversation - be curious. They say something, what would I want to know about that?
- Give people engaging answers ('hooks') to jump in a conversant. As part of this, be prepared to answer the 'How about you?' question
- Focus on the basic questions: Who/what/where/how/why
- Simply show emphathy: ‘That’s amazing’ ‘That sucks’
- Hooks 
  - Relate their experience to something I experienced: "That reminds me of a time when..."
  - “That was an amazing game, that last goal! Wow, what did you like?” 
  - Speak to something you've done/are thinking about and ask if they can relate in any way. “I’m trying to learn Chinese, preparing for our new overlords. Do you speak any
second languages?”
- Statements
  - Share random interesting facts
- Experience sharing: What did I experience lately that I want to share?
  - I read this article 
  - I met this friend in the pub and X happened 
- Small talk questions
  - Any books your read / movies / series you saw? 
  - Any travelling plans?
  - Question around situation: e.g. in news, at the office. "Did you hear about X" 
  - Ask for opinions: What do you think about X? 

**New joiner at work**
- Hey I don’t think we’ve met yet. I’m Dave. Great to meet you. 
- What team are you working in? 
- What are some of the challenges you'll be tackling?
- Where were you before?
- It's great having you - let's catch up soon? 

**Passing people in the office**
- Hey - how are you? 

**When I know the person / speak with friends**
- Speak about a topic you're both interested in 
- Ask about what's happening in their lives
- Anything new / exciting in their lives

**Unkown people**
- Comment on the context (Situations, news, setting, people)
  - “This coffee place has a nice nostalgic interior, don’t you agree?”
  - “So who invited you to the party?”
  - "How do you the host?"
  - "What brought you here?"
  - "Do you know many people here?"

## Social interactions at work
- Regular mindful breaths and remind yourself you’re in an office - it’s a social environment and you can’t just be stuck in your mind on your own work. Work is more than that - use the mindfulness to recenter 
- When others are speaking, just listen. If you want to say something, say it. This is mainly situations where I’m just at my desk 
- If someone does something for the team or for you, take a moment to thank them sincerely and show that you appreciate what they’ve done. 
- When people are leaving, wish them well 

## Social basic principles to live by 
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- Be kind
- Be enthusiastic and energetic
- Focus on the positive and on appreciation 
- Don’t judge, criticize, condemn or complain. People are just what we would be under similar circumstances. 
- Consider the other person's point of view and be empathetic 
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things, engage with good stories. 
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them. 
- Do good deeds to others: open the door for others, smile at a stranger, help your neighbour / friend. 
- Try to mimic their body language to enhance trust and rapport. 
- Be authentic and genuine. The more open you are, the more people can relate and the safer it is for them to express themselves / the more they trust you. 
- Smile 
- Be curious
- Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. 
- Don't take it all too seriosuly and just have fun. 

## Other
- Thank people for the impact they’ve had on your life: teachers, early managers. Track them down and write a genuine note
- Everybody is either a potential friend or we can help one another out in some way 
- Realize that everyone has issues, good/bad experiences, dealt with shitty jobs, break-ups, good and bad times and together we make things just a bit better
- People like others who are like themselves. 
- People love talking about themselves.
- If someone does something bad to us, hold off. “You can always tell the man off tomorrow, if it’s such a good idea”. 

## Principles
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. People are unique and we all have stories to tell. Focus on finding out about their story: focus on their past experiences, their hobbies, their ambitions and their feelings and emotions and motivations.   

## Storytelling 
TO DO 

## 1-1 Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
    - Flow in conversation: give an invitation to speak = ask an interesting question. Give inspiration to speak = tell something interesting yourself
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 
- Always be prepared to answer the ‘what about you?’ question

## Group conversations 
- Visualize yourself as being someone who loves being right in the centre of attention, sharing stories and opinions.  Because everybody is keep on listening to you and understand what it is you have to say. Be more influential and funny 
- Realize that group conversations are about shallow, fun conversation rather than sharing information. Stupid things are being said, laughed at and nobody cares.  
- People want you to be open. They want to know you, trust and feel comfortable around sharing things themselves. By not sharing yours, people don't feel good sharing about their lives as they might think I judge them. 
- You want to engage because you could make friends. If you're closed and invicible, people wouldn't want to know more / invite you to activities etc.  
- Once you are, good friends will accept you and take you in their lives. If the judge based on what I say, they'll never end up being good friends anyway. 
- Put more priority and thought into being around other people and in the centre of attention. I never visualized it, I never prepared for it and then when it happens, I am lost. Also, spend more time thinking of things I can/want to speak about in conversations
- Become the more well rounded person with hobbies, an understanding and opinion of many things that I can use as hooks in conversations. It'll also help in creative thought. Get rid of my narrow horizon
- In social settings, have a calm mind which will allow me to think on my feet 
- Engage in some way from the start to reduce anxiety. Give the impression you're engaged - mind your body language. This will ensure others engage with you as they will see when you're not comfortable. 
- Speak to the person next to you / Focus on one person at a time - no need to always address the entire group 
- When put on the spot: don't feel obliged to answer: 'I'll get back to that' at work. 'I'd rather not say that as it makes me uncomfortable' in a personal session
- How to be vulnerable in conversations: 
  - Realize we all have our issues 
  - There is no perfect answer - whatever comes up in that moment in the answer you go with instead. It's ok and what I say is good enough - just be myself. Once you have something to say, don't hesitate. The moment you start questioning whether or not what you have to say is worthy it will be to late and the topic will change. Speak for the sake of speaking
  - Don't be too much in your own head thinking about my performance in the setting. Let go of the feeling that I need to speak. Just accept things as they are. Stop trying and stop worrying - it'll not help performance and it will decrease happiness. As long as youfocuses on themselves, they really can't contribute anything of substance to a group, and hence you don't get the attention. 
  - Trust the people around you and allow your heart to open and be vulnerable 
  - Don't care as much about how they may interpret or judge what I say 

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Remembering names
Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 
- Concentrate your attention to it. E.g. when someone introduces themselves, concentrate your attention on the introduction and the person’s name. Repeat a few times what you want to remember  
- Use the person's name occasionally during the conversation
- Associate the name with something else. E.g. associate it with a friend who made the introduction 
- Repeat what you wish to remember whilst concentrating on it. 

## Friendships 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it - understand them instead. Just be there for them. Instead: that must be horrible. It reminds me of when (vulnerable, how did it make you feel and make sound smaller than their issue). Then: what are you doing about it?
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Friendships are about being there for others but most defintely also about allowing others to be there for us. Be open to receive the love
- Great friendships could come from couple friends

## Accept others
- Rather than being defensive against suggestions, accept other solutions too. 
- Also, don't try to always bucket things - it's often not either/or - instead, seek a middle ground/compromise.
- When people share their concerns with me, be sure to listen - don't disregard it because you have a different opinion. Go deep into why they think that way and see if there is something that ought to be done. 
- Don't give unsolicited advice and don't jump into 'let me fix that' mode. Far too often, we project our own experiences onto others expecting the situation to be the same. 
- But often this is like: I don't / wouldn't ever do this, so I value this as bad which of course doesn't really make sense as people live by their own values and they likely differ from my values. 

## First impression 
- Dress the part
- A good handshake. Hand straight, ensure hand palm contact, wrap hand then lock thumb down squeeze as much as the other. Finally shake from the elbow for 3 times and step back. 
- When exiting a conversation, try to give them something of value and then say it was a pleasure meeting you and move on. 

## Listening 
- Cornerstone to this is being present. Good listeners never interrupt – they just wait and remember what they want to say next. Allow others to interrupts you – the point is to make others feel right. 
- Use verbal acknowledgment that you listen
  - “Interesting”
  - “Sounds cool”
  - “Yes, go on”
  - "Seriously?"
  - "Tell me more"
- Use nonverbal acknowledgment that you listen
  - “Nodding”
  - “mmmmm” / “uhuh”
- Ask follow-up questions to keep people talking?
  - “How did that make you feel?”
  - “And then what?”
  - “What were you thinking when that happened?”
- Rephrase what they said
- Reflect feeling. Reflect to them how they’re feeling. ‘I’m done with school!’ > ‘You’re frustrated’
- Encourage people to talk about themselves. 
- Very often when someone says something, we focus on having a judgement on that, rather than really understanding something. We should spend more time instead trying to really understand what the meaning of the statement is to the other person  
- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Focus on asking questions and let the other party do most of the talking. Don’t interrupt once you e.g. disagree with something they said. Instead, let them talk themselves out. Listen patiently and with the open mind. Encourage them to express themselves fully. 
- When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions; you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.
- Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion.
- Immediately into a conclusion and a label and this is how it is. Instead take time to explore and ask questions
- We often only hear what we already think. We should try to listen to discover something new. Challenge what people say from a position of openness 
- Don’t seek the truth, just drop your opinions 

## Charisma 
It's about presence, power and warmth:
- When you meet someone charismatic, you’ll feel that they hold enough power to move mountains for you and that they like you a lot. Power means being perceived as being able to affect the world around us. This is about making others feel inspired, make them believe. Warmth is goodwill towards others
- Someone who is charismatic will be reported as being extremely present – all they care about is the person or group they are engaging with. Make sure other peoples opinions are valued and that the people are important or at least feel that way. Make them feel welcomed and accepted. To be more present, practice meditation. In a conversation, ask yourself whether you are present. If not, focus on breath for a few seconds and then back to the person 

Other tips: 
- Visualize being charismatic
- Pretend you are who you want to be
- Body language is key. Make very few movements - the lion doesn't fidget. Make sure to not nod too often, don’t use too much verbal reassurance (uh-huh etc), don’t fidget. Get comfortable with silence and stillness 
- Warmth by becoming grateful and appreciate things, especially about the little things in life. 
- Goodwill and compassion: make people feel like they’re the only people in the world. Goodwill is the simple state of wishing others well. Start by thinking of 3 things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill about. Also, think ‘I like you’ when you see someone. 
- Compassion is empathy (understanding how someone feels) plus goodwill (wishing them well). Build compassion for someone by imagining their past (what would it have been like to grow up under their circumstances? Under the same circumstances, I might have turned out the same) Imagine their present – place yourself in their shoes now and imagine all the feelings they might have 
- Self compassion: this is the things you do when you have a hard time. Also, think about someone you admire and who is warm and compassionate. Think through their eyes telling you that you are absolutely perfect at this stage in your life. It can also be enhanced using photos that make you feel warm or e.g. quotes of others 

## Dealing with others
- We may not be saintly enough to love our enemies, but, for the sake of our own health and happiness,let's at least forgive them and forget them.
- One sure way to forgive and forget our enemies is to become absorbed in some cause infinitely bigger than ourselves.
- Had we been in the same conditions and circumstances, we may just have done the same thing. 
- Give people understanding and let's hope the best for them 
- Like myself, people are asses - so don't be surprised when they act like it. 
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- When you are criticized, you are important because they spend energy on you. 
- Don't expect too much from people 
- The negative feeling is in you. Someone else might be perfectly calm under the same circumstances. 
- When you don’t want to, say no. That’s not selfish – it’s selfish to assume you should live your life as someone else sees fit. Don’t feel obligated to be with someone
