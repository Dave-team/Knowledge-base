# Social

## Principles
- It’s something that takes work: you can’t just be passive. Instead, force yourself to be in social settings, face yourself to say things and take initiative. 
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. People are unique and we all have stories to tell. Focus on finding out about their story: focus on their past experiences, their hobbies, their ambitions and their feelings and emotions and motivations
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them.   
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- A human touch often goes a very long way, don’t be afraid to touch. Especially when meeting someone and saying goodbye: shake hands, hug, kiss 
- A social interaction takes preparation:  consider who you want to talk about, what you’d and the other person would likely want to talk about  
- Don’t judge people 
- Be kind
- Consider the other person's point of view 
- When going to a social event, make it worthwhile or don't go at all 
- Thank people for the impact they’ve had on your life: teachers, early managers. Track them down and write a genuine note
- Remember peoples names and make you note when you find out their name. Then study to not forget
- Everybody is either a poetntial friend or we can help one another out in some way 

## Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
    - Flow in conversation: give an invitation to speak = ask an interesting question. Give inspiration to speak = tell something interesting yourself
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- It doesn’t matter what you say, just have something to add in a conversation. It’s about adding value to a group convo. If you don’t, you’re invincible. Work on being more creative to then come up with more things to say 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 
- Always be prepared to answer the ‘what about you?’ question

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Friendships 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it - understand them instead. Just be there for them. Instead: that must be horrible. It reminds me of when (vulnerable, how did it make you feel and make sound smaller than their issue). Then: what are you doing about it?
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Friendships are about being there for others but most defintely also about allowing others to be there for us. Be open to receive the love
- Great friendships could come from couple friends

## Relationships
- A good relationship is about being there for them when they need us. Be understanding and let them share their emotions. A good relationship is bonding on an emotional level. The ideal is when you are part of the other person reaching their goals 
- Every relationship is voluntary - everyone is free to decide as they please and values change. You can’t make people do things and they can make up and/or change their minds at any time. A relationship is still comprised of individual people that live their own life 
- A good relationship is based on trust, honesty, communication, belief in each other and support. It’s about making one another better and having fun in the process 
- Don’t be complacent / take a relationship for granted. It’s hard work to be a good spouse. Take initiative and show that you care and give one another personal space
- First and foremost, live a happy and interesting independent live - don’t be depending on the relationship for happiness. And bring the partner in as part of that life. 
- The only thing we control is our contribution to the relationship. Keep working on making things better
- Seperate work issues from any relationship - be in the moment. Don’t make your headaches contagious 
- Don’t be needy, controlling and insecure. This comes from a fear of losing her. Realise that being a confident spouse is the thing that reduces risk of losing her   
- Gifts: 
    - The gesture matters - it's about showing love and appreciation
    - Ideas could always be around experiences and something personal or handmade
    - Keep a running log of things they'd like to have 
- Show that you care with small things. Buy the occasional flower. Give compliments. Bring something from holidays 
- Be honest and share how you feel
- Aim to do lots of fun things that you both enjoy doing. Aim to invite others too 
- Speak the right love language and keep the emotional love tank filled at all times 
- Set aside time to work on the relationship:
    - What we like
    - What we don’t like
    - What we’d like to see more of
