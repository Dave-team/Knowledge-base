# Social

## Principles
- It’s something that takes work: you can’t just be passive. Instead, force yourself to be in social settings, face yourself to say things and take initiative. 
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. People are unique and we all have stories to tell. Focus on finding out about their story: focus on their past experiences, their hobbies, their ambitions and their feelings and emotions and motivations
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them.   
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- A human touch often goes a very long way, don’t be afraid to touch. Especially when meeting someone and saying goodbye: shake hands, hug, kiss 
- A social interaction takes preparation:  consider who you want to talk about, what you’d and the other person would likely want to talk about  
- Don’t judge people 
- Be kind
- Consider the other person's point of view 
- When going to a social event, make it worthwhile or don't go at all 
- Thank people for the impact they’ve had on your life: teachers, early managers. Track them down and write a genuine note
- Remember peoples names and make you note when you find out their name. Then study to not forget
- Everybody is either a potential friend or we can help one another out in some way 
- Be enthusiastic, show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me. Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose
- Realize that everyone has issues, good/bad experiences, dealt with shitty jobs, break-ups, good and bad times and together we make things just a bit better
- Send more random things to friends. It’s not always about catching up and meeting. It’s about being top of mind and regular contact. Send them things they also like and give them things of value
- A most effective way of developing an attractive personality in being able to stand on your feet and speak convincingly. Put feeling and emotion into your words as you speak and develop a deep, rich tone of voice. Also be interested in people and give praise. 
- Appreciate people for who they are 
- In addition to being grateful for the positives in our lives, another way to activate and support our new positive core beliefs is to do kind things for other people. Examples include opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend, smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs

## 1-1 Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
    - Flow in conversation: give an invitation to speak = ask an interesting question. Give inspiration to speak = tell something interesting yourself
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 
- Always be prepared to answer the ‘what about you?’ question

## Group conversations 
- Realize that group conversations are about shallow, fun conversation rather than sharing information. Stupid things are being said, laughed at and nobody cares.  
- People want you to be open. They want to know you, trust and feel comfortable around sharing things themselves. By not sharing yours, people don't feel good sharing about their lives as they might think I judge them. 
- You want to engage because you could make friends. If you're closed and invicible, people wouldn't want to know more / invite you to activities etc.  
- Once you are, good friends will accept you and take you in their lives. If the judge based on what I say, they'll never end up being good friends anyway. 
- Put more priority and thought into being around other people and in the centre of attention. I never visualized it, I never prepared for it and then when it happens, I am lost. Also, spend more time thinking of things I can/want to speak about in conversations
- Become the more well rounded person with hobbies, an understanding and opinion of many things that I can use as hooks in conversations. It'll also help in creative thought. Get rid of my narrow horizon
- In social settings, have a calm mind which will allow me to think on my feet 
- Engage in some way from the start to reduce anxiety. Give the impression you're engaged - mind your body language. This will ensure others engage with you as they will see when you're not comfortable. 
- Speak to the person next to you / Focus on one person at a time - no need to always address the entire group 
- When put on the spot: don't feel obliged to answer: 'I'll get back to that' at work. 'I'd rather not say that as it makes me uncomfortable' in a personal session
- How to be vulnerable in conversations: 
  - Realize we all have our issues 
  - There is no perfect answer - whatever comes up in that moment in the answer you go with instead. It's ok and what I say is good enough - just be myself. Once you have something to say, don't hesitate. The moment you start questioning whether or not what you have to say is worthy it will be to late and the topic will change. Speak for the sake of speaking
  - Don't be too much in your own head thinking about my performance in the setting. Let go of the feeling that I need to speak. Just accept things as they are. Stop trying and stop worrying - it'll not help performance and it will decrease happiness. As long as youfocuses on themselves, they really can't contribute anything of substance to a group, and hence you don't get the attention. 
  - Trust the people around you and allow your heart to open and be vulnerable 
  - Don't care as much about how they may interpret or judge what I say 

- Visualize yourself as being someone who loves being right in the centre of attention because everybody is keep on listening to you and understand what it is you have to say. Be more influential and funny 

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Remembering names
- Concentrate your attention to it. E.g. when someone introduces themselves, concentrate your attention on the introduction and the person’s name. Repeat a few times what you want to remember  
- Associate the name with something else. E.g. associate it with a friend who made the introduction 
- Repeat what you wish to remember whilst concentrating on it. 

## Friendships 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it - understand them instead. Just be there for them. Instead: that must be horrible. It reminds me of when (vulnerable, how did it make you feel and make sound smaller than their issue). Then: what are you doing about it?
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Friendships are about being there for others but most defintely also about allowing others to be there for us. Be open to receive the love
- Great friendships could come from couple friends

## Accept others
- Rather than being defensive against suggestions, accept other solutions too. 
- Also, don't try to always bucket things - it's often not either/or - instead, seek a middle ground/compromise.
- When people share their concerns with me, be sure to listen - don't disregard it because you have a different opinion. Go deep into why they think that way and see if there is something that ought to be done. 
- Don't give unsolicited advice and don't jump into 'let me fix that' mode. 
- But often this is like: I don't / wouldn't ever do this, so I value this as bad which of course doesn't really make sense as people live by their own values and they likely differ from my values.
