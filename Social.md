# Social

## Principles
- It’s something that takes work: you can’t just be passive. Instead, force yourself to be in social settings, face yourself to say things and take initiative. 
- Be genuinely interested in people and want to meet and find out about them. People are unique and we all have stories to tell. Focus on finding out about their story: focus on their past experiences, their hobbies, their ambitions and their feelings and emotions and motivations
- What people want: 
    - Have fun: do fun things
    - Feel important: give them compliments 
    - Feel liked and valued: be there for them.   
- Give without expecting anything in return 
- A human touch often goes a very long way, don’t be afraid to touch. Especially when meeting someone and saying goodbye: shake hands, hug, kiss 
- A social interaction takes preparation:  consider who you want to talk about, what you’d and the other person would likely want to talk about  
- Don’t judge people 
- Be kind
- Consider the other person's point of view 
- When going to a social event, make it worthwhile or don't go at all 
- Thank people for the impact they’ve had on your life: teachers, early managers. Track them down and write a genuine note
- Remember peoples names and make you note when you find out their name. Then study to not forget
- Everybody is either a poetntial friend or we can help one another out in some way 
- Be enthusiastic, show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me. Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose
- Realize that everyone has issues, good/bad experiences, dealt with shitty jobs, break-ups, good and bad times and together we make things just a bit better
- Send more random things to friends. It’s not always about catching up and meeting. It’s about being top of mind and regular contact. Send them things they also like and give them things of value


## Conversations
- A good conversation consists of: 
    - Asking each other questions - be curious about the other
    - Exchanging stories and saying interesting things 
    - Flow in conversation: give an invitation to speak = ask an interesting question. Give inspiration to speak = tell something interesting yourself
- Keep a converstion going by making statements that allow someone else to jump in and continue the conversation. Of course this also works the other way where I jump on a hook in the conversation
- Use the other person's name during a conversation 
- It doesn’t matter what you say, just have something to add in a conversation. It’s about adding value to a group convo. If you don’t, you’re invincible. Work on being more creative to then come up with more things to say 
- Good questions to ask: 
    - What have you been thinking about recently? 
    - What interesting things have you done or seen recently? 
- Always be prepared to answer the ‘what about you?’ question

## Making friends
- Go to places you enjoy being. This is where you'll meet like minded people
- Every person can become a best friend - you don't know until you connect so approach them, introduce yourself and start a conversation
- Take the initiative in suggesting something to do based on a similar interest
- Always say yes to things other people suggest to do 
- If possible, invite more people to do something
- Exchange contact details

## Friendships 
- We should be vulnerable: open to discuss our issues and allow others to support us. This will help establish trust
- Don’t give unsolicited advice. Realize that people are not waiting for your advice until they ask for it - understand them instead. Just be there for them. Instead: that must be horrible. It reminds me of when (vulnerable, how did it make you feel and make sound smaller than their issue). Then: what are you doing about it?
- Surround yourself with people with good values - you are the average of the people you spend most time with 
- Friendships are about being there for others but most defintely also about allowing others to be there for us. Be open to receive the love
- Great friendships could come from couple friends
