# Design & UX
## Principles
- Don’t make people think 
- Categorize that what belongs together, together and make sure you have clear separate areas that make conventional sense 
- Make use of conventions – put things where people would expect those things to be 
- Eliminate all questions that could be in the heads of your users 
- People glance over content – make sure that the most important aspects jump out of the clutter using contrast 
- Eliminate clutter 
- Minimize any noise 
- Make sure your users are able to know exactly where they are – what page, which area, how far in the process 
- Never make a user repeat him or herself 
- Provide feedback throughout any process 
- Ensure things are fast
- Implement human centered design – build things on the psychology on how people work with applications 
- Make things consistent
