# Reading
- Skim books before reading
- Only read those books that do provide value - no obligation to finish a started book
- Read a few good books often rather than many books once 
- Read more books at the same time: combine a light and a heavy book to increase total reading time 
- Read constantly. Have 10 minutes? Read 
- Read according to energy levels. Don't read a textbook prior to sleeping
- Read with the intend to teach. How would you be able to take the learnings and teach others? What are the key ideas and insights? What are the open questions for exploration? 



Note taking
- Take notes in the margins
- Highlight 
- Write up summary myself
- Look at other summaries online to verify and improve
- Revise the summary often 
- Integrate into other knowledge to create mental links
- Good books are meant to be reread
