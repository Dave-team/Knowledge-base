# Reading
## Inspectional reading
- Skim through the book: look at title page, TOC, look for interesting parts. Answer these questions:
  - What is the book about?
  - What kind of book is this?
  - Who is the author? What is their background? 
  - What is the aim of the author when he/she decided to write the book?
  - Is the book worth reading in its entirety? 

## Analytical reading
- Find the plot/the storyline: how do the themes in the book relate to each other? 
- Really think about what you're reading. 
  - Pause to think about what you read
  - Create a mental picture 
  - Think about what you can apply what you read
  - Do you agree with the author?
- Take notes
  - Highlight passages
  - Comment in the margins 
  - End of book: summarize book 
  - Look at other summaries online to verify and improve
  - Other tips:
    - Circle words to look up
    - Star points critical to the argument 
    - Write down unanswered questions you should get back to 
    - End of chapter: write a few bullet points that summarize what I read 
    - When taking notes, try to apply it to something in your own life 
- Learn from the book 
  - Explain the chapter to yourself in a way that a 10 year old would understand 
  - Think long and hard about the book 
  - Make vivid mental pictures in your mind about what you are reading 
  - Once done with the book, take a sheet of paper and explain core ideas or arguments of the book to yourself. Review notes when required. Link the findings from the book to other things learned to increase understanding  
  - After the book, refer back to the main principles in regular intervals. Ideally, you also apply what you learned. Come back to the book and review notes, highlights and open questions. Revise the summary I made of the book  
  - Summarize each chapter in your head after each chapter. Recall concepts, use visualizations, metaphors and analogies 
  - After reading, critically access the book. Strengths and weaknesses 

## General tips
- Only read those books that do provide value - no obligation to finish a started book
- Read a few good books often rather than many books once 
- Read more books at the same time: combine a light and a heavy book to increase total reading time 
- Read constantly. Have 10 minutes? Read 
- Read according to energy levels. Don't read a textbook prior to sleeping
- Read with the intend to teach. How would you be able to take the learnings and teach others? What are the key ideas and insights? What are the open questions for exploration? 
- Read more books around the same concept to get a good grip of the material 
- When reading, don't get stuck on what you don't understand. Make a note of it and continue. It likely doesn't matter and you can always come back to it 
- If you read to learn, realize that reading a book will take a lot of time. Reading a book is not meant to be done quickly if the book is worth anything. Most books are just not worth it so they can be read quickly.
