# Management 

## Principles
- You are responsible for the team's output 
- Give credit to the team when things go well and take full responsibility when they don't
- Make your employees feel comfortable with you – they should feel free to share their thoughts and recommendations 
- Don’t be the manager you wish you had – be the manager that your team needs. Everyone is different and everyone is at different stages. Some people need more feedback and deadlines whereas others can just be left alone 
- People want to know: 
    - Do you have insights and steadiness to make tough decisions?
    - Do you have values they relate to admire and want to emulate
    - Do you have the right kind of energy?
    - Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others? 
- Lead by example
- Always track and measure whether we are on the right track – what can we improve on? 
- Demonstrate best practice by showing best practice and guide them through your thinking 
- Treat your team like your family. Do not stress them out with too much work. Be respectful of their time and effort. Give them breaks post completion of major tasks. Every second that you let them rest and breathe is a second you have invested in the future. They will recharge and put their best in the next task. Realize that you most often don't know what's going on in their lives and adding stress to it might get adverse effects
- Where required, step in to tackle a big challenge with a teammate
- Provide lots of positive feedback and be genuine and enthusiatic when doing so 

## Six foundations to leadership
- Clarity: communicate goals, strategy and vision over and over 
- Commitment: make sure everyone is in and buys the goals
- Translation: translate the goals, vision strategy to the people within the organization and their day to day activities 
- Enabling: make sure that the people are able to perform their jobs well
- Synergy: people have to get along well
- Accountability: make sure everyone feels accountable (themselves and each other) to the mission, vision and strategy

## How to get things done 
- Make sure the interests of the team are aligned with the company’s
- Put people in the right position
- Give people challenging projects 
- Give people information and context required to do their job. 
    - What? What are we doing?
    - So what? Why are we doing it?
    - Now what? What are the next steps?
- Confirm that they know what they do. A good idea here is to have them create an action plan that then is discussed. Here, be criticial and provide context in your way of thinking
- Get out of their way. Believe in them to come up with good solutions

## Roadmap building 
You're responsbile over the creation of the roadmap. This is a cross functional excercise with the execs in the business 

## Backlog managment 
This is how we track the progress across the team and it's how team time spend is being measures 
- Be ahead of the game in terms of what the team could/should be working on next

## Empoyer your team
- If someone has an idea that you think might not work, ask how long it’ll take them to see if it works out?
- Sometimes, you just let the team decide even when you think you have the right answer. There are often many right answers and your job is to ensure that the team doesn’t choose the wrong answer. 
- Empower the quiet people in the team to speak up during meetings: 'X': what do you think? then thank him. This will help: 
    - It removes the internal conflict Jim was having if he should speak up or not. 
    - It gives him 'the floor' so he knows for a minute he will be heard. 
    - His answer might not be directly related, however it often sets off a chain of conversation that often does lead to creative answers.

## Servant leadership 
- You are at the service or your team and your sole objective is to make the team perform well. 
- Protect them from politics 
- Make sure they don't get distracted
- Unblock them 
- Ask them how you can help
- You’re a facilitator, not a doer
- Always be available to your team
    
## Difficult conversations
- Have difficult conversations in person and stick to the facts 

## Develop the team  
- People seek: 
    - autonomy the freedom to do their work well 
    - mastery the opportunity to get better at what they do
    - purpose the desire to add value to the world
- Figure out where they want to go and help them get there
- Create develop plans with SMART goals 

## Feedback
- Praise people often and recognize people's good work. Praise them publicly and in front of other senior people 
- Give little criticism. When you do give critisism, be honest and specific and work towards improvements 
- Create a culture where any feedback is welcome by and from everyone in the business 
- When giving feedback, make it specific and constructive.
- Performance reviews: 
    - Be specific about their strenghts and how this has helped in practice 
    - Talk about impact. Why is this person’s work important to the organization? Did they do an especially good job on a specific project they worked on?
    - Talk about the future: what could the person be doing better? 
        - Suggest an ambitious goal that would be interesting to reach
        - Suggest to do more of something they do little of right now 
        - Pick something you know the person wants to do more of

## Evangelize
You want to communicate what the team is going to work on: 
- explain the goals - why is this gonna be awesome?
- explain who’s affected by the project
- talk about the risks
- talk about timelines

This is important because: 
- It helps planning accross teams as projects overlap on depend on each other
- Advertising a plan might cause someone to notice an important problem with it and tell us!
- It helps setting a bar - when you seel amazing projects people realize the value you bring and it holds you to high standards 

## Team values 
- Competence. Does this person have the technical competence and experience to do the job effectively? 
- Judgment. Does this person exercise good judgment, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good? 
- Energy. Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is he or she burned out or disengaged? 
- Focus. Is this person capable of setting priorities and sticking to them, or prone to “riding off in all directions”? 
- Relationships. Does this individual get along with others on the team and support collective decision making, or is he or she difficult to work with? 
- Trust. Can you trust this person to keep his or her word and follow through on commitments? 

## 1 on 1s
- Held weekly 
- Focus on the employee
    - How is he/she finding it
    - What is he / she thinking about? 
    - What is he/she working on and what are the priorities? 
    - What's woorying you about the team? 
    - Are you happy with your current project?
    - Do you feel like you;re learning? Are there things you're not learning, but would like to? 
    - Any problems?
    - How is development going – my aim is to help employees reach potential 
    - Room for honest feedback
    - Open discussion
- Agenda to be set by employee 
- Employee does 80% of the talking 
- ‘Seek first to understand before being understood’
- Keep adding notes in a shared 1:1 doc. It avoids not having things to speak about 
- Add notes to 1:1 doc after to spot patterns and see if you haven't discussed a topic in a while but maybe should 

## Goal setting 
- Management by Objectives (MBO)
    - Establish unambiguous and realistic objectives.
    - Periodically evaluate if objectives are being met.
    - Implement corrective action
- OKRs
    - Objectives are concise and high level - it's like an exciting statement
    - Key results are easily measurable and lead to achievement of the objective. 'How would we know if we met our objective'? Ideally it's a KPI measurement. Otherwise it could be a project completed or for example a survey result. Users are happy vs we measured their satisfaction rate and we reached an average CSAT of 80% and higher. Also make sure that the key results specifically drive business value and avoid that the key results are too tightly related to activities. E.g. don’t say implement Looker but say a BI tool has been implemented 
    - OKRs should be difficult to obtain 

## Other

- Always consider continguency when someone in the team is away 
- Always be highly aware of what's happening in your sprint as well as with tickets in other team's sprints
