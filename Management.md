# Management 

## Principles
- You are responsible for the team's output - give credit to the team when things go well  and take full responsibility when they don't
- Make your employees feel comfortable with you – they should feel free to share their thoughts and recommendations 
- Don’t be the manager you wish you had – be the manager that your team needs. Everyone is different and everyone is at different stages 
- People want to know: 
    - Do you have insights and steadiness to make tough decisions?
    - Do you have values they relate to admire and want to emulate
    - Do you have the right kind of energy?
    - Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others? 
- Lead by example
- Always track and measure whether we are on the right track – what can we improve on? 

## Six foundations to leadership
- Clarity: communicate goals, strategy and vision over and over 
- Commitment: make sure everyone is in and buys the goals
- Translation: translate the goals, vision strategy to the people within the organization and their day to day activities 
- Enabling: make sure that the people are able to perform their jobs well
- Synergy: people have to get along well
- Accountability: make sure everyone feels accountable (themselves and each other) to the mission, vision and strategy


## How to get things done 
- Make sure the interests of the team are aligned with the company’s
- Put people in the right position
- Give people challenging projects 
- Give people information and context required to do their job 
- Confirm that they know what they do 
- Get out of their way. Believe in them to come up with good solutions

## Empoyer your team
- If someone has an idea that you think might not work, ask how long it’ll take them to see if it works out?
- Sometimes, you just let the team decide even when you think you have the right answer. There are often many right answers and your job is to ensure that the team doesn’t choose the wrong answer. 

## Servant leadership 
- Protect them from politics 
- Make sure they don't get distracted
- Unblock them 
- Ask them how you can help
- You’re a facilitator, not a doer
    
## Difficult conversations
-	Have difficult conversations in person and stick to the facts 

## Develop the team  
- People seek: 
    - autonomy the freedom to do their work well 
    - mastery the opportunity to get better at what they do
    - purpose the desire to add value to the world
- Figure out where they want to go and help them get there
- Create develop plans with SMART goals 

## Feedback
- Praise people often and recognize people's good work. Praise them publicly and in front of other senior people 
- Give little criticism. When you do give critisism, be honest and specific and work towards improvements 
- Create a culture where any feedback is welcome by and from everyone in the business 

## Evangelize
You want to communicate what the team is going to work on: 
- explain the goals - why is this gonna be awesome?
- explain who’s affected by the project
- talk about the risks
- talk about timelines

This is important because: 
- It helps planning accross teams as projects overlap on depend on each other
- Advertising a plan might cause someone to notice an important problem with it and tell us!
- It helps setting a bar - when you seel amazing projects people realize the value you bring and it holds you to high standards 



## Team values 
-	Competence. Does this person have the technical competence and experience to do the job effectively? 
-	Judgment. Does this person exercise good judgment, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good? 
-	Energy. Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is he or she burned out or disengaged? 
-	Focus. Is this person capable of setting priorities and sticking to them, or prone to “riding off in all directions”? 
-	Relationships. Does this individual get along with others on the team and support collective decision making, or is he or she difficult to work with? 
-	Trust. Can you trust this person to keep his or her word and follow through on commitments?

## 1 on 1s
- Held weekly 
- Focus on the employee
    - How is he/she finding it
    - What is he/she working on
    - Any problems?
    - How is development going – my aim is to help employees reach potential 
    - Room for honest feedback
    - Open discussion
- Agenda to be set by employee 
- Employee does 80% of the talking 
-	‘Seek first to understand before being understood’



## Goal setting 
-	Management by Objectives (MBO)
    - Establish unambiguous and realistic objectives.
    - Periodically evaluate if objectives are being met.
    - Implement corrective action
- OKRs
    - Objectives are concise and high level 
    - Key results are easily measurable and lead to achievement of the objective. 'How would we know if we met our objective'? Ideally it's a KPI measurement. Otherwise it could be a project completed or for example a survey result
    - OKRs should be difficult to obtain 




Other
-	Only delegate what you really understand
-	Use 360 degrees feedback
