# Management 

## A good manager
- Is a good coach
- Empowers team and does not micromanage
- Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
- Is productive and results-oriented
- Is a good communicator – listens and shares information
- Supports career development and discusses performance
- Has clear vision/strategy for team
- Has key technical skills to help advise team
- Collaborates
- Is a strong decision maker
- People want to know: 
  - Do you have insights and steadiness to make tough decisions?
  - Do you have values they relate to admire and want to emulate
  - Do you have the right kind of energy?
  - Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others? 
- As the manager, focus on: 
  - Timeline: protect your team 
  - Priority: how urgent is this compared to other projects? 
  - What is the simplest thing we can do to make it better, realising it won’t be perfect

## Principles
- Believe in yourself. You can’t lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse.
- Be a leader: a leader is someone who is in the moment when listening, adds value/support where he can to other points and provides authority, influence and clarity on next steps when presenting. The more confidence you have, the more impact you’ll have. Both for leaders as well as public speakers  
- Make your employees feel comfortable with you – they should feel free to share their thoughts and recommendations 
- Be in the centre of the business - know what's going on within other teams at any time. 
- Don’t be the manager you wish you had – be the manager that your team needs. Everyone is different and everyone is at different stages. Some people need more feedback and deadlines whereas others can just be left alone 
- At any one point in time, you want to be the person most suited for the job you carry. This also implies that you need to aim to continually improve what you do, what the team outputs and where the business is going. 
- Really know your team. What is happening in their lives? How do they prefer to work? How do they like to get feedback? How do we communicate? What do they value? What do they fear? Where do they want to go?  
- Lead by example
- Treat your team like your family. Do not stress them out with too much work. Be respectful of their time and effort. Give them breaks post completion of major tasks. Every second that you let them rest and breathe is a second you have invested in the future. They will recharge and put their best in the next task. Realize that you most often don't know what's going on in their lives and adding stress to it might get adverse effects
- Don't forget to take advice from others. They are there to help and support where they can.
- Don't take it personally. You will be making tonnes of mistakes and that's okay. 
- Be aware of the organizational architecture: 
  - Strategy: The core approach the organization will use to accomplish its goals
  - Structure: How people are situated in units and how their work is coordinated
  - Systems: The processes used to add value
  - Skills: The capabilities of the various groups of people in the organization
  - Culture: The values, norms, and assumptions that shape behavior 

## Servant leadership 
You are responsible for the team's output - they need to be happy and productive. Your primary focus changes from yourself to the team. You are at the service or your team and your sole objective is to make the team perform well. To facilitate this: 
- Protect them from politics 
- Make sure they don't get distracted
- Unblock them 
- Ask them how you can help
- You’re a facilitator, not a doer
- Always be available to your team

## Toughness
- People will push and prod to discover your boundaries. Knowing when to stand back and when to stand firm is half the battle. Occasionally someone will push too far. When they do, you have to show a rough edge or you’ll lose authority with your team. A firm “I’m not ok with that” is usually enough.
- Have an opinion about things and have conviction to follow through unless a better counter example has been provided. Avoid hopping from approach to approach.
- Your team looks to you for leadership. Have the courage to say what everyone knows to be true but isn’t saying. You need to be willing to make unpopular decisions 
- Don’t laugh things off if you don’t feel like laughing them off. Have the courage to show your true emotions.
- You need to be tough - e.g. wanting to put project on backburner - why are you stuck? Let’s step by step solve those points we’re stuck on 

## Tips
- Make others feel really valued. Go up to their desk and ask for help. Check in on progress. Once a project is finished, thank them sincerely and make them feel good
- Give credit to the team when things go well and take full responsibility when they don't
- Always track and measure whether we are on the right track – what can we improve on? 
- Demonstrate best practice by showing best practice and guide them through your thinking 
- Always consider continguency when someone in the team is away 

## Phrases
- What I would do is
- If you know of a better way then let me know - I’m sure what we have is not perfect
- I really like X / X is great 
- How would you do it? What do you think is the best way?
- “I don’t love this”
- EOD 'do you need anything from me'
- Practice empathy: 'I’m sorry to hear that'

## Team productivity 
### Workload management
- Define and work towards roadmap projects
- With the backlog, always be aware of the priorities and what the team should work on next (ideally team would know this without you telling them). Also be aware of what's happening in other team's sprints. Make sure to keep the backlog up to date and ensure that stakeholders are aware of status at all times
- As part of daily routine of checking emails, also start looking into the tickets that the team is working on. 

### Situational leadership / Task Relevant Maturity (TRM)
- Adept your leadership style based on confidence and competence of the team members.
- Only delegate what you really understand and what you're happy to no longer control.
- When you don't know something exactly either as a manager: Learn about the topic together. You can’t necessarily coach the other person but you can learn the same things together and then be one anothers sounding board. You can't possibly know everything but you can still support to the extend possible. If I don’t know an answer, ask for examples so we can look at things together   
- Where required, step in to tackle a big challenge with a teammate
- TRM
  - Low TRM: detailed instructions: what needs to be done, when and how. It’s task oriented
  - Medium TRM: open communication, support and encouragement 
  - High TRM: minimum management involvement. Agree on objectives and then get out the way but still monitor performance

### How to get things done 
- Make sure the interests of the team are aligned with the company’s
- Put people in the right position
- Give people challenging projects 
- Give people information and context required to do their job. Help them connect the dots.
    - What? What are we doing?
    - So what? Why are we doing it? Who else would be interested in this?
    - Now what? What are the next steps?
- Confirm that they know what they do. A good idea here is to have them create an action plan that then is discussed. Here, be criticial and provide context in your way of thinking
- Get out of their way. Believe in them to come up with good solutions
- Often timebox activities to avoid spending loads of time on something that is not possible or not worth the effort 

### Decision making
- Don’t let people pressure you into decisions you don’t believe in. They’ll hold you responsible for them later, and they’ll be right. Decisions are your responsibility.
- Everyone involved must give the decision reached full support. This doesn’t have to mean agreement – so long as participants agree to commit that is fine 
- Good decisions are made where people know the technical details of things and from experience where people have tried to do similar things in the past. That’s why it’s often critical to include a senior person in such situations 
- If you’re trying to reach consensus for a decision but at some point you feel like you heard everything, aim for consensus. If that fails, you need to step in and make a decision 
- When opinions come into play, see if there is an easy to test something rather than to decide on something we don't know enough about
- Only make decisions when it'll have impact. If not, do not interfere with something that is already working. 
- With each decision, consider:
  - What decision needs to be made?
  - When does it have to be made?
  - Who will decide?
  - Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision? 
  - Who will ratify or veto the decision?
  - Who will need to be informed of the decision? 


## Feedback
- Praise people often and recognize people's good work. Praise them publicly and in front of other senior people. Do it genuinely and with enthusiasm
- Give little criticism. When you do give critisism, be honest specific and constructive and work towards improvements 
- Create a culture where feedback is encouraged - e.g. make it an essential part of the daily standup
- Giving hard feedback is sometimes needed. Giving hard feedback becomes easier over time. Once you give a lot of feedback, eventually you’ll get better at it. If none of your conversations are ever tough, that is likely a problem. Engage in more tougher conversations and ensure it doesn’t scare you off/make you feel for the other person etc. It’s often not personal and even if it is, it sometimes must be
- When delivering hard or generally important feedback, just take notes with you. Hey I hope you don’t mind but I brought these with me so I don’t forget anything. Also, similar to e.g. public speaking, practice giving feedback - e.g. with your manager. 
- If things get emotional, give the recipient some space and time to process. Revisit the conversation the next day.
- When to give feedback: 
  - Real time is powerful
  - Regular 1-1 (every 3 weeks)
  - Around key events (before project launch, midpoint, end)
- Where to give feedback: 
  - Beware of power dynamics and overly open spaces
  - Positive feedback can be public, while constructive is better private
  - Be creative with format: On a walk, Over lunch, Coffee chat
- How to give feedback:
  - Positive is as important as constructive
  - Own the feedback (“I said” vs. “he said”)
  - Tailor your approach to your style, the recipient’s style and your relationship

### Performance reviews: 
- Keep an ongoing list of feedback topics to discuss
- Be specific about their strenghts and how this has helped in practice 
- Talk about impact. Why is this person’s work important to the organization? Did they do an especially good job on a specific project they worked on?
- Focus on the most important aspects rather than overloading and confusing the subordinate. 
- Talk about the future: what could the person be doing better? 
  - Suggest an ambitious goal that would be interesting to reach
  - Suggest to do more of something they do little of right now 
  - Pick something you know the person wants to do more of
- How to deliver appraisels: 
  - Be frank
  - Listen: really make sure you points are heard. Look at non verbal. Do they give appropriate responses indicating they understand? If not, keep going until you are completely understood 
  - Leave yourself out. This is about and for the subordinate. All your personal feelings should be left out. 
- Giving feedback stepwise
  - Is now a good time for feedback? 
  - I have noticed X during specific example Y 
  - I know that you have good intentions
  - However, this makes me feel like Y
  - Because it is our goal for me to become Z, going forward can we do Y?

## Development plan 
**Questions to start with**
- Life story
  - What has led this person to their current role?
  - What choices have they made and why?
  - What has excited them and motivated them?
  - Look for what people care about
- Dreams
  - What does this person hope to achieve in future?
  - Look for 3-5 answers so you can tease out real answers from answers they think you want
- Action plan
  - Where does this person need to develop to reach their dreams?
  - How can you both help them move confidently in the direction of their dreams?

**Other development plan notes**
- Link objectives / areas back to main role objectives
- Each goal is clearly measurable. E.g. reading books is not measurable. Attending conferences is not measurable - specify which conferences. Often, it's about having implemented X 
- People seek: 
    - autonomy the freedom to do their work well 
    - mastery the opportunity to get better at what they do
    - purpose the desire to add value to the world
- Figure out where they want to go and help them get there
- Create develop plans with SMART goals 

## Coaching 
- Don't make decisions unless you really have to. Let the team figure them out mostly themselves where possible. 
- If someone has an idea that you think might not work, ask how long it’ll take them to see if it works out?
- Sometimes, you just let the team decide even when you think you have the right answer. There are often many right answers and your job is to ensure that the team doesn’t choose the wrong answer. To help understand their thinking, ask questions around how they came to this decision. 
- Empower the quiet people in the team to speak up during meetings: 'X': what do you think? then thank him. This will help: 
    - It removes the internal conflict Jim was having if he should speak up or not. 
    - It gives him 'the floor' so he knows for a minute he will be heard. 
    - His answer might not be directly related, however it often sets off a chain of conversation that often does lead to creative answers.

**Grow framework**

## Communication 
- Meetings: lead communication and steer it into the direction you need it to go to. Don’t be afraid of cutting people short 
- An introduction: who are you? Where were you before? What do you focus on? How do we interact?

**Communication methods**
- Is it a simple quick question for a colleague? Instant message.
- Is it a relatively quick question but needs some context? Email.
- Is it something that requires more than 3 single lines of explanation? Phone call.
- Is it something that would require probably more than 10 minutes of explanation/conversation? Plan a 30-minute meeting.
- Is it something that requires more of a discussion? Do a meeting time you think is appropriate but only after you've tried to break down your problem into smaller chunks and see if steps 1 through 4 won't work.

**Evangelizing work**
You want to communicate what the team is going to work on: 
- explain the goals - why is this gonna be awesome?
- explain who’s affected by the project
- talk about the risks
- talk about timelines

This is important because: 
- It helps planning accross teams as projects overlap on depend on each other
- Advertising a plan might cause someone to notice an important problem with it and tell us!
- It helps setting a bar - when you seel amazing projects people realize the value you bring and it holds you to high standards

## Difficult conversations
- Have difficult conversations in person and stick to the facts 
- Don't blame and assume. Instead, resolve your feelings by communicating with people
![Conflict de-escalation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28791247/101979753-b74c8a00-3c57-11eb-88ac-50bed643943e.png)

## 12 questions employees ask themselves
- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the equipment and material I need to do my work right?
- At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
- In the past seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?
- Does my superior or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?
- Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
- At work, do my opinions seem to count?
- Does the mission/ purpose of my company make me feel my work is important?
- Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
- Do I have a best friend at work?
- In the last six months, have I talked to someone about my progress?
- This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?

## Team values 
- Competence. Does this person have the technical competence and experience to do the job effectively? 
- Judgment. Does this person exercise good judgment, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good? 
- Energy. Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is he or she burned out or disengaged? 
- Focus. Is this person capable of setting priorities and sticking to them, or prone to “riding off in all directions”? 
- Relationships. Does this individual get along with others on the team and support collective decision making, or is he or she difficult to work with? 
- Trust. Can you trust this person to keep his or her word and follow through on commitments? 

## Six foundations to leadership
- Clarity: communicate goals, strategy and vision over and over 
- Commitment: make sure everyone is in and buys the goals
- Translation: translate the goals, vision strategy to the people within the organization and their day to day activities 
- Enabling: make sure that the people are able to perform their jobs well
- Synergy: people have to get along well
- Accountability: make sure everyone feels accountable (themselves and each other) to the mission, vision and strategy

## Vision
- Vision is something you learn and the best way is to learn from others. Ask those who have been where you want to go. 

## Goal setting 
- Management by Objectives (MBO)
    - Establish unambiguous and realistic objectives.
    - Periodically evaluate if objectives are being met.
    - Implement corrective action
- OKRs
    - Objectives are concise and high level - it's like an exciting statement
    - Key results are easily measurable and lead to achievement of the objective. 'How would we know if we met our objective'? Ideally it's a KPI measurement. Otherwise it could be a project completed or for example a survey result. Users are happy vs we measured their satisfaction rate and we reached an average CSAT of 80% and higher. Also make sure that the key results specifically drive business value and avoid that the key results are too tightly related to activities. E.g. don’t say implement Looker but say a BI tool has been implemented 
    - OKRs should be difficult to obtain 

## Starting as a manager in an existing team 
As you start your job, critically assess each role and performance. If something doesn’t work, make changes, which can include firing people. Your peers know that someone doesn’t work well and they need you to see the same and make the hard decisions 

Ask your direct reports: 
- What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face) in the near future? 
- Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?
- What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
- What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? 
- If you were me, what would you focus attention on? 
- How can we improve the team works together?
