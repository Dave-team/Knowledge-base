# Management 

Papier notes
New joiner: lots of easy wins that don’t have time pressure. Don’t do these yourself 

## Role of the manager
-	Managers function: not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to do work
-	Management in 3 steps: 
  - Get the right people
  - Make them happy so they don’t leave
  - Turn them loose – people are individuals – encourage them to form their own squads 
-	The goal of teamwork: teams should jell. This means the output of the jelling team is greater than the sum of its parts when they all buy into the same common goal or objective. Get people the face the same direction and get them fired up to the point that nothing would really stop their progress, not even their manager. In these cases, it’s basically a bunch of people working together to achieve a common goal 

## A good manager
- Is a good coach
- Empowers team and does not micromanage
- Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
- Is productive and results-oriented
- Is a good communicator – listens and shares information
- Supports career development and discusses performance
- Has clear vision/strategy for team
- Has key technical skills to help advise team
- Collaborates
- Is a strong decision maker
- People want to know: 
  - Do you have insights and steadiness to make tough decisions?
  - Do you have values they relate to admire and want to emulate
  - Do you have the right kind of energy?
  - Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others? 
- As the manager, focus on: 
  - Timeline: protect your team 
  - Priority: how urgent is this compared to other projects? 
  - What is the simplest thing we can do to make it better, realising it won’t be perfect
- Learn: 
  - Learn how to say "no."
  - Learn how to say "I was wrong."
  - Learn how to say "I don't know."
  - Realize it's ok to change your mind


## Principles
- Believe in yourself. You can’t lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse.
- Be a leader: a leader is someone who is in the moment when listening, adds value/support where he can to other points and provides authority, influence and clarity on next steps when presenting. The more confidence you have, the more impact you’ll have. Both for leaders as well as public speakers  
- Make your employees feel comfortable with you – they should feel free to share their thoughts and recommendations 
- Be in the centre of the business - know what's going on within other teams at any time. 
- Don’t be the manager you wish you had – be the manager that your team needs. Everyone is different and everyone is at different stages. Some people need more feedback and deadlines whereas others can just be left alone 
- At any one point in time, you want to be the person most suited for the job you carry. This also implies that you need to aim to continually improve what you do, what the team outputs and where the business is going. 
- Really know your team. What is happening in their lives? How do they prefer to work? How do they like to get feedback? How do we communicate? What do they value? What do they fear? Where do they want to go?  
- Lead by example
- Treat your team like your family. Do not stress them out with too much work. Be respectful of their time and effort. Give them breaks post completion of major tasks. Every second that you let them rest and breathe is a second you have invested in the future. They will recharge and put their best in the next task. Realize that you most often don't know what's going on in their lives and adding stress to it might get adverse effects
- Don't forget to take advice from others. They are there to help and support where they can.
- Don't take it personally. You will be making tonnes of mistakes and that's okay. 
- Be aware of the organizational architecture: 
  - Strategy: The core approach the organization will use to accomplish its goals
  - Structure: How people are situated in units and how their work is coordinated
  - Systems: The processes used to add value
  - Skills: The capabilities of the various groups of people in the organization
  - Culture: The values, norms, and assumptions that shape behavior 
- Go from: “ I know I’m right” to “How do I know I’m right”. 
- Have very strong mental maps on how things should be done. But make sure to test this in the real world and be flexible enough to improve on the maps or to take a different route when the situation asks for it 
- See things from a high and strategic level but at the same know what’s happening in the details. This skill is rare but extremely valuable 
- Remember that people are wired very differently – what works for someone may not work for someone else. And people behave very differently in different situations. You need to account for that and threat people based on that 
- When someone holds an opinion, make sure to dig deeper: what makes you say that / what data are you looking at?
- As a manager, you’re not likely to change anyone that much
- Always remember that there are multiple ways to get to a desired outcome
- Let the other person feel like the idea is his or hers. Don’t ram your opinions through the throats of others. Instead, make suggestions and let the other person reach their own conclusion. In the same way, we like to buy but we don’t like to be sold. 
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. If you want to improve someone in a certain aspect, assume that that trait is already part of his or her great characteristics. 
- Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. Let someone know that they have a flair for doing something and that you have faith in their ability to succeed and they’ll practice long hours and often end up succeeding. 
- You want to put people in the right position and then essentially just trust them to do a good job 
- People need reassurance from time to time that they’re headed in the right direction 
- Improve quality by:
  - Training. People do what they know how to do 
  - Tools
  - Peer reviews
- Never assume that people understand what is expected of them – make it very clear instead 
- Goal setting: Make it very clear what someone’s responsibilities are and what they are held accountable for. Both manager and employee keep a short copy of the goal to refer back to. When defining these goals, set the expectations very clear – make sure they know what success looks like 
-	When junior people do something wrong, go back to goal setting and clarify what is expected of them and show them what good looks like 
- Do things yourself when the stake are high and you're the best person for the job. If stakes are low and/or if others can do it well, delegate. 
- Compensation should be part of a process so it's always for everyone in the business. This avoid politics.  

## Servant leadership 
You are responsible for the team's output - they need to be happy and productive. Your primary focus changes from yourself to the team. You are at the service or your team and your sole objective is to make the team perform well. To facilitate this: 
- Protect them from politics 
- Make sure they don't get distracted
- Unblock them 
- Ask them how you can help
- You’re a facilitator, not a doer
- Always be available to your team

## Conscious leadership 
Conscious Leadership is about being more interested in learning than being right. When our egos make us afraid to be wrong, that fear leads us to defend our ideas at all costs, and to work too hard to convince others that we are right—often with anger. Conscious Leadership is about recognizing when these emotions (fear, anger, sadness) have gripped our thought processes, releasing these emotions, and shifting back to a state of curiosity where we are receptive to all. 

**Leading from above the line**
At any point, a leader is either above the line or below the line. If you are above it, you are leading consciously, and if you are below it, you are not. Above the line, one is open, curious, and committed to learning. Below the line, one is closed, defensive, and committed to being right.

Many people lead from below the line - it’s a common state stemming from millions of years of evolution. As soon we we sense the first whiff of conflict our lizard brain kicks in. Fear and Anger rise up, we get defensive and double down on being right. At this point we’re firmly below the line.

Knowing that you’re below the line is more important than being below the line. The first mark of conscious leadership is self-awareness and the search for truth. The second is pausing, taking a second, and shifting yourself into a open and curious state, and rising above the line.

**Taking Radical Responsibility**
Conscious leaders and teams take full responsibility—radical responsibility—instead of placing blame.  Radical responsibility means locating the cause and control of our lives in ourselves, not in external events. 

Instead of asking “Who’s to blame?”, conscious leaders ask, “What can we learn and how can we grow from this?”  Conscious leaders are open to the possibility that instead of controlling and changing the world, perhaps the world is just right the way it is. This creates huge growth opportunities on a personal and organization level.

**Learning through Curiosity**
Self-awareness and learning agility are known to create sustained success in leaders—they form the foundation of conscious leadership.  

Conscious leaders are passionately committed to knowing themselves, which is the basis of their willingness to live in a state of curiosity.  At any point, leaders are either above the line (open, curious, and committed to learning) or below the line (defensive, closed and committed to being right).  

Being “right” doesn’t cause drama, but wanting, proving, and fighting to be “right” does. Even though conscious leaders get defensive like everyone else, they regularly interrupt this natural reactivity by pausing to breathe, accept, and shift. 

**Feeling all Feelings**
Conscious leaders know that feelings are natural and expressing them is healthy. They know that emotion is energy in motion; feelings are simply physical sensations. Conscious leaders learn to locate, name, and release their feelings. They know that feelings not only add richness and color to life but are also an essential ally to successful leadership.

**Speaking candidly**
Leaders and teams have found that seeing reality clearly is essential to being successful.  In order to see reality clearly, leaders and organizations need everyone to be truthful and not lie about, or withhold, information. They need candor.  Candor is the revealing of all thoughts, feelings, and sensations in an honest, open, and aware way.  

Conscious listening takes courage: we must listen for the content (head center), the emotions (heart center), and base desire (gut center) being expressed by the other person.  It is best to start with candor in relationships only when you have a shared commitment to it, along with the necessary skills, including being able to speak unarguably.

**Eliminating gossip**
Gossip is a statement about another made by someone with negative intent or a statement the speaker would be unwilling to share in exactly the same way if that person were in the room. 

People gossip to gain validation, control others and outcomes, avoid conflict, get attention, feel included, and make themselves right by making others wrong. In short, people usually gossip out of fear.  If you gossip, clean it up by revealing your participation in the gossip to everyone involved. 

**Integrity** 
Integrity is the practice of keeping agreements, taking responsibility, revealing authentic feelings, and expressing unarguable truths. It is essential to thriving leaders and organizations.

Conscious leaders are impeccable with their agreements. They make clear agreements, keep them, renegotiate them when needed, and clean them up when broken.  Integrity is fundamental to conscious leadership and successful thriving organizations.

**Generating appreciation**
Living in appreciation has two branches: being open to fully receiving appreciation and being able to fully give appreciation

**Living a life of play and rest**
Creating a life of play, improvisation, and laughter allows life to unfold easily and energy to be maximized. Conscious leaders who value and encourage an atmosphere of play and joy within themselves and in their organizations create high-functioning, high-achieving cultures.

**Exploring the opposite**
Conscious leaders practice simple ways to question the beliefs that cause suffering, starting with “Is it true?” and “Can I absolutely know it is true?”  The turnaround exercise allows leaders to practice shifting their beliefs from knowing to curiosity.  When conscious leaders let go of the righteousness of their beliefs, they open to curiosity and align with their deepest desires.

## Toughness
- People will push and prod to discover your boundaries. Knowing when to stand back and when to stand firm is half the battle. Occasionally someone will push too far. When they do, you have to show a rough edge or you’ll lose authority with your team. A firm “I’m not ok with that” is usually enough.
- Have an opinion about things and have conviction to follow through unless a better counter example has been provided. Avoid hopping from approach to approach.
- Your team looks to you for leadership. Have the courage to say what everyone knows to be true but isn’t saying. You need to be willing to make unpopular decisions 
- Don’t laugh things off if you don’t feel like laughing them off. Have the courage to show your true emotions.
- You need to be tough - e.g. wanting to put project on backburner - why are you stuck? Let’s step by step solve those points we’re stuck on 
- Say what you think and think what you feel. Don’t care about how things might be perceived by others – the thing to do is the thing that feels right

## Tips
- Make others feel really valued. Go up to their desk and ask for help. Check in on progress. Once a project is finished, thank them sincerely and make them feel good
- Give credit to the team when things go well and take full responsibility when they don't
- Always track and measure whether we are on the right track – what can we improve on? 
- Demonstrate best practice by showing best practice and guide them through your thinking 
- Always consider continguency when someone in the team is away 

## Phrases
- What I would do is
- If you know of a better way then let me know - I’m sure what we have is not perfect
- I really like X / X is great 
- How would you do it? What do you think is the best way?
- “I don’t love this”
- EOD 'do you need anything from me'
- Practice empathy: 'I’m sorry to hear that'
- 'How can I help you?'
- 'How can I unblock you?'
- 'Do you think this could work?'

## Team productivity 
### Workload management
- Define and work towards roadmap projects
- With the backlog, always be aware of the priorities and what the team should work on next (ideally team would know this without you telling them). Also be aware of what's happening in other team's sprints. Make sure to keep the backlog up to date and ensure that stakeholders are aware of status at all times
- As part of daily routine of checking emails, also start looking into the tickets that the team is working on. 

### Situational leadership / Task Relevant Maturity (TRM)
- Adept your leadership style based on confidence and competence of the team members.
- Only delegate what you really understand and what you're happy to no longer control.
- When you don't know something exactly either as a manager: Learn about the topic together. You can’t necessarily coach the other person but you can learn the same things together and then be one anothers sounding board. You can't possibly know everything but you can still support to the extend possible. If I don’t know an answer, ask for examples so we can look at things together   
- Where required, step in to tackle a big challenge with a teammate
- TRM
  - Low TRM: detailed instructions: what needs to be done, when and how. It’s task oriented
  - Medium TRM: open communication, support and encouragement 
  - High TRM: minimum management involvement. Agree on objectives and then get out the way but still monitor performance

### How to get things done 
- Fundamentally: make them want to do it. When asking for something, always pause and ask: why would this person want to do this?  
- Make sure the interests of the team are aligned with the company’s
- Put people in the right position
- Give people challenging projects 
- Give people information and context required to do their job. Help them connect the dots. We are very motivated and inclined to follow through with their own suggestions. 
    - What? What are we doing?
    - So what? Why are we doing it? Who else would be interested in this?
    - Now what? What are the next steps?
- Confirm that they know what they do. A good idea here is to have them create an action plan that then is discussed. Here, be criticial and provide context in your way of thinking
- Get out of their way. Believe in them to come up with good solutions
- Often timebox activities to avoid spending loads of time on something that is not possible or not worth the effort 

### Decision making
- Don’t let people pressure you into decisions you don’t believe in. They’ll hold you responsible for them later, and they’ll be right. Decisions are your responsibility.
- Everyone involved must give the decision reached full support. This doesn’t have to mean agreement – so long as participants agree to commit that is fine 
- Good decisions are made where people know the technical details of things and from experience where people have tried to do similar things in the past. That’s why it’s often critical to include a senior person in such situations 
- If you’re trying to reach consensus for a decision but at some point you feel like you heard everything, aim for consensus. If that fails, you need to step in and make a decision 
- When opinions come into play, see if there is an easy to test something rather than to decide on something we don't know enough about
- Only make decisions when it'll have impact. If not, do not interfere with something that is already working. 
- With each decision, consider:
  - What decision needs to be made?
  - When does it have to be made?
  - Who will decide?
  - Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision? 
  - Who will ratify or veto the decision?
  - Who will need to be informed of the decision? 

**Write-ups**
If you want the most effective and efficient decision-making process, require that anyone who wants to discuss an issue write it up, along with the desired solution, ahead of time. The goal of this write-up is to be thorough enough that at the time of decision-meeting, there are few or no questions. This can be achieved one of two ways:
1. The hard way: Write an extraordinarily thorough analysis from the get-go.
2. The easy way: Write a draft, circulate it to the meeting participants before the meeting, and invite comments and questions. Then write out responses to all of these comments and questions prior to the meeting.

**Decision making options**
One of the core challenges in leadership is how to get your team to buy into a decision. It’s often easy to make a decision, but it can be much harder to get your team to invest emotionally in that decision. 
You create buy-in when you make people feel they are part of the decision, and that their input contributes to the final outcome. The more influence they feel they have on the outcome, the more they’ll be invested in the final result. 
Broadly, there are three ways to make a decision. Each has a different time requirement, and creates a different level of buy-in. There are no free lunches here, unfortunately—the method that creates the most buy-in also takes the most time. 
The methods are: 
1. Manager makes the decision, announces it to the team, and answers questions. 
Pro: Takes very little time. 
Con: Creates very little buy-in from the team. And gets no benefit from their collective knowledge and experience. 
1. Manager creates (or assigns someone to create) a written straw man (a hypothetical answer designed to inspire discussion), shares it with the team, invites team to give feedback (written and verbal), facilitates group discussion, determines final answer. 
Pro: Creates more buy-in. Gets some minimal benefit from the collective wisdom of the team. 
Con: Takes more time. 
3. Manager invites team to a meeting where dilemma is discussed from scratch with no straw man. Manager and team equally share ideas. Final decision is determined by consensus if possible. 
Pro: Creates the most buy-in. Gets a lot of benefit from the collective wisdom of the team. 
Con: Takes the most time. 

So, which method should you use? It depends on how significant the decision is, and how important buy-in is. For everyday, low-impact issues (eg- the venue for the holiday party), Method 1 is sufficient. For major, core issues (eg- Company 10-Year Vision), Method 3 is necessary. For everything in between (the vast majority of important decisions), Method 2 is optimal. 

Whenever you choose to use Method 3 to get full buy-in, know that, as CEO, your voice will be the “loudest in the room”. In order to get full buy-in, you will have to elicit people’s truest thoughts. Once people hear your perspective, some % will naturally alter their own views to more closely match yours. This % is much higher than you might imagine. People assume that as CEO you have more information than they do, and therefore your perspective is probably more correct. Later, these same people will not feel fully bought-in to the outcome, because internally they will know that their true thought was not actually heard. So, in order to get the full benefit of your team’s knowledge and to make sure that they get to full buy-in, be careful not to “tip your hand” before all others have shared theirs. The most effective way to do this is to have people write down their vote and/or their thoughts prior to you sharing your perspective. 

**RAPID decision making**
- Someone identifies an issue or decision that needs to be made.  They write up:
  - The Issue
  - The Proposed Solution
  - The list of people needed to make and implement the decision:
    - R (Recommend) = the one who first proposed the Issue and Solution
    - A (Agree) = those people whose input must be incorporated in the decision
      - This is usually Legal, who are ensuring that no one is breaking the law!
    - P (Perform) = those people who will have to enact any decision and therefore should be heard
    - I (Input) = those people whose input is worth considering
    - D (Decide) = the one who will make the decision 
      - If a Type 1 decision (irreversible), this should be the CEO.
      - If a Type 2 decision (reversible), this should be someone other than the CEO.
  - A section on the document for each person above to write their comments.

The R then reaches out to all the As, Ps and Is to solicit their input. Once this input is received, the document is ready to be reviewed by the D. The R schedules a Decision Meeting and invites the D, As, Is and Ps. If the issue is urgent, the R schedules this Decision Meeting as soon as it needs to be. If the issue is non-urgent, the R can use the next Team Meeting as the Decision Meeting.  (This is much more efficient, and should be done whenever the issue is non-urgent.)

At the Decision Meeting, the D reads through the document.  If she has any questions, she asks them.  If her questions can be fully answered in 5 minutes, she decides.  If they cannot be answered in 5 minutes, she asks for another round of written responses on the document to answer her questions.  At the next Team Meeting, she reviews these responses, and decides. Once the D decides, she writes up the Decision (or asks the R to do so) along with all the Next Actions (each with a DRI and Due Date).  The D then publishes this decision to the company.

## Conflict resolution
Most people “hate” each other, because they feel unheard. For me to respect you, I don’t need for you to agree with me. But I do need for you to hear what I have to say. When I tell you my perspective (which I of course believe to be right) and you aren’t immediately convinced, then I assume that you didn’t really hear or understand what I said. If you start sharing your perspective, I will be uncompelled and unwilling to truly listen, because you haven’t been willing to consider mine. And the cycle spirals downward to hate and acrimony. 

There is a simple fix. I only need to prove to you that I have “heard” you. And to do that, I only need to repeat back what you’ve said (summarized, of course) until you say “That’s right!” Then you will feel heard. You will now be open to hearing what I have to say. 
To resolve conflict, you only need to get each person to state their deepest, darkest thoughts, and then prove that each has heard what the other has said. 

## Feedback
- Praise people often and recognize people's good work. 
  - Catch someone doing something right and immediately praise them
  - Look them in the eye and say what they did right. Then tell them how amazing you feel about what they did and how this helps the organization. 
  - Pause for a second to let in sink in
  - Encourage them to do more of the same 
  - Praise them publicly and in front of other senior people. 
  - Do it genuinely and with enthusiasm and be specific. 
- Give little criticism. When you do give critisism: 
  - When someone does something wrong, tell them immediately in specific terms what they did wrong
  - Tell them how you feel about what you did – be honest here (e.g. frustrated)
  - Stop for a few seconds to make it a bit uncomfortable 
  - Remind them how much you value them 
  - Reaffirm you think well of them (they are always very competent), but not how they handled this situation
  -  be honest specific and constructive and work towards improvements 
- Create a culture where feedback is encouraged - e.g. make it an essential part of the daily standup
- Giving hard feedback is sometimes needed. Giving hard feedback becomes easier over time. Once you give a lot of feedback, eventually you’ll get better at it. If none of your conversations are ever tough, that is likely a problem. Engage in more tougher conversations and ensure it doesn’t scare you off/make you feel for the other person etc. It’s often not personal and even if it is, it sometimes must be
- When delivering hard or generally important feedback, just take notes with you. Hey I hope you don’t mind but I brought these with me so I don’t forget anything. Also, similar to e.g. public speaking, practice giving feedback - e.g. with your manager. 
- If things get emotional, give the recipient some space and time to process. Revisit the conversation the next day.
- If they get defensive and angry, you will be able to see that and say: “I didn't intend to make you feel angry. My intent was to be helpful." 
- When to give feedback: 
  - Real time is powerful
  - Regular 1-1 (every 3 weeks)
  - Around key events (before project launch, midpoint, end)
- Where to give feedback: 
  - Beware of power dynamics and overly open spaces
  - Positive feedback can be public, while constructive is better private
  - Be creative with format: On a walk, Over lunch, Coffee chat
- How to give feedback:
  - Positive is as important as constructive. Always start with the positive
  - Own the feedback (“I said” vs. “he said”)
  - Tailor your approach to your style, the recipient’s style and your relationship

**Noviolent communication template**
When I observe Z, I feel Y emotions because I need Z. Would you be willing to do X to help me meet my need(s) for Y?

1. Ask for permission. Give the receiver a little heads-up of what’s coming. It can be enough to say “I have something to communicate to you, is now a good time?” 
2. State the trigger behavior or event. Try to be factual (“When you are late to meetings...”) as opposed to interpretative (“When you disrespect me...”). 
3. State how that trigger behavior makes you feel. This is perhaps the hardest part for many founders to do. Talking about your feelings might not be something you are used to, so it might be challenging at first. However, doing so is crucial for the other person to truly understand where you are coming from and to take your feedback to heart. 
4. State the thoughts, opinions and judgements (story) you have around this situation.
5. Make a request of what you would like to see.  Try to frame it as positive action (“do x”) rather than a negative (“don’t do y”).
6. Ask if the person accepts the feedback and the request.  If yes, hold them accountable to doing it.

**Seek out feedback**
Frequent, transparent feedback is critical for building a strong culture and a thriving business. Critical feedback in particular should be cherished. Therefore, if you are to receive real, honest feedback and improve, and keep your team communicating, YOU must make the effort to seek it out. Here are three particularly powerful ways to do so: 

1. Ask for it: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished, but cherished. It is important to explicitly say this to them, preferably in a one-on-one setting. When asking for feedback on the company in general, it is useful to ask, “If you were CEO, what would you change?” You can do this in-person or through an anonymous survey. 

Acknowledge it 
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying “I think I heard you say …”  Summarize what they said.  Then say “Is that right?”  If they yes, you are done.  If they say no, ask them to say it again until you are able to summarize it correctly.  This is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection.  People want to feel heard.  And they can only know that you heard them if you actually say back their words to them.

2. Appreciate it. Don’t interrupt your team member. Don’t give excuses. Your job is to listen and try your utmost to understand. Only once you understand the issue, and you’ve repeated it back to them, and they know that you’ve understood their issues, can you initiate a conversation about potential solutions. 

3. Act on it. Actions speak infinitely louder than words. If you have agreed with someone’s negative feedback, work on changing the problem immediately. Do not let it fall through the cracks. Doing so will result in your team losing trust in your word, and therefore losing motivation. Put it in a tracker with a due date. 

### Performance reviews
- Keep an ongoing list of feedback topics to discuss
- Be specific about their strenghts and how this has helped in practice 
- Talk about impact. Why is this person’s work important to the organization? Did they do an especially good job on a specific project they worked on?
- Focus on the most important aspects rather than overloading and confusing the subordinate. 
- Talk about the future: what could the person be doing better? 
  - Suggest an ambitious goal that would be interesting to reach
  - Suggest to do more of something they do little of right now 
  - Pick something you know the person wants to do more of
- How to deliver appraisels: 
  - Be frank
  - Listen: really make sure you points are heard. Look at non verbal. Do they give appropriate responses indicating they understand? If not, keep going until you are completely understood 
  - Leave yourself out. This is about and for the subordinate. All your personal feelings should be left out. 
- Giving feedback stepwise
  - Is now a good time for feedback? 
  - I have noticed X during specific example Y 
  - I know that you have good intentions
  - However, this makes me feel like Y
  - Because it is our goal for me to become Z, going forward can we do Y? 

COIN framework:

## Development plan 
**Questions to start with**
- Life story
  - What has led this person to their current role?
  - What choices have they made and why?
  - What has excited them and motivated them?
  - Look for what people care about
- Dreams
  - What does this person hope to achieve in future?
  - Look for 3-5 answers so you can tease out real answers from answers they think you want
- Action plan
  - Where does this person need to develop to reach their dreams?
  - How can you both help them move confidently in the direction of their dreams?

**Other development plan notes**
- Link objectives / areas back to main role objectives
- Each goal is clearly measurable. E.g. reading books is not measurable. Attending conferences is not measurable - specify which conferences. Often, it's about having implemented X 
- People seek: 
    - autonomy the freedom to do their work well 
    - mastery the opportunity to get better at what they do
    - purpose the desire to add value to the world
- Figure out where they want to go and help them get there
- Create develop plans with SMART goals 

## Coaching 
- Don't make decisions unless you really have to. Let the team figure them out mostly themselves where possible. 
- If someone has an idea that you think might not work, ask how long it’ll take them to see if it works out?
- Sometimes, you just let the team decide even when you think you have the right answer. There are often many right answers and your job is to ensure that the team doesn’t choose the wrong answer. To help understand their thinking, ask questions around how they came to this decision. 
- Empower the quiet people in the team to speak up during meetings: 'X': what do you think? then thank him. This will help: 
    - It removes the internal conflict Jim was having if he should speak up or not. 
    - It gives him 'the floor' so he knows for a minute he will be heard. 
    - His answer might not be directly related, however it often sets off a chain of conversation that often does lead to creative answers.

## Communication 
- Meetings: lead communication and steer it into the direction you need it to go to. Don’t be afraid of cutting people short 
- An introduction: who are you? Where were you before? What do you focus on? How do we interact?

**Communication methods**
- Is it a simple quick question for a colleague? Instant message.
- Is it a relatively quick question but needs some context? Email.
- Is it something that requires more than 3 single lines of explanation? Phone call.
- Is it something that would require probably more than 10 minutes of explanation/conversation? Plan a 30-minute meeting.
- Is it something that requires more of a discussion? Do a meeting time you think is appropriate but only after you've tried to break down your problem into smaller chunks and see if steps 1 through 4 won't work.

**Evangelizing work**
You want to communicate what the team is going to work on: 
- explain the goals - why is this gonna be awesome?
- explain who’s affected by the project
- talk about the risks
- talk about timelines

This is important because: 
- It helps planning accross teams as projects overlap on depend on each other
- Advertising a plan might cause someone to notice an important problem with it and tell us!
- It helps setting a bar - when you seel amazing projects people realize the value you bring and it holds you to high standards 

## 1-1s
- Held weekly 
- Focus on the employee
    - How is he/she finding it
    - What is he / she thinking about? 
    - What is he/she working on and what are the priorities? 
    - What's woorying you about the team? 
    - Are you happy with your current project?
    - Do you feel like you're learning? Are there things you're not learning, but would like to? 
    - Any problems?
    - How is development going – my aim is to help employees reach potential 
    - Room for honest feedback
    - Open discussion
- Give feedback
  - Say what did you like about the team member’s actions since the previous meeting? Be specific. What do you wish would change? (During the week, actively look for actions to compliment.) State these as specific future actions.
- Seek feedback
  - What did you like about the manager’s or the company’s actions since the previous meeting? 
  - What do you wish that I would do differently as manager? Please think of the feedback that you are afraid to give me because you think that it will hurt my feelings.  Please give me that feedback.
- Action on the feedback 
  - Be very thankful for it, and then act to resolve the stated issues quickly. This is the key to making a team member feel heard and valued. 
- Set goals
  - Ensure that the OKRs are still relevant.
  - Ensure that their declared actions for the upcoming week are the straightest line to achieving their OKRs.
  - Ensure that their Proposed Solutions are the straightest line to solving the Issue.
  - Ensure that they have copied and pasted all of their actions (from OKRs and Issues/Solutions) into the group task manager.
- Agenda to be set by employee 
- Employee does 80% of the talking 
- ‘Seek first to understand before being understood’.
- Focus on asking loads of questions and understand problems and get to root causes. 
- Keep adding notes in a shared 1:1 doc. It avoids not having things to speak about 
- Add notes to 1:1 doc after to spot patterns and see if you haven't discussed a topic in a while but maybe should 

## Team meeting 
- Hold each other accountable to the actions they need to perform
- Surface and resolve any issues in the company
- Give each other feedback

It is critical that everyone submit all of their updates, issues and feedback in writing prior to the meeting. This allows others to read the submissions, make comments, and ask questions prior to the meeting
    
## Difficult conversations
- Have difficult conversations in person and stick to the facts 
- Don't blame and assume. Instead, resolve your feelings by communicating with people
- To deal with disagreements: be open minded (see things through the other person’s eyes) and be assertive (communicate clearly how things look like through your eyes)

## 12 questions employees ask themselves
- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the equipment and material I need to do my work right?
- At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
- In the past seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?
- Does my superior or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?
- Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
- At work, do my opinions seem to count?
- Does the mission/ purpose of my company make me feel my work is important?
- Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
- Do I have a best friend at work?
- In the last six months, have I talked to someone about my progress?
- This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?

## Team values 
- Competence. Does this person have the technical competence and experience to do the job effectively? 
- Judgment. Does this person exercise good judgment, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good? 
- Energy. Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is he or she burned out or disengaged? 
- Focus. Is this person capable of setting priorities and sticking to them, or prone to “riding off in all directions”? 
- Relationships. Does this individual get along with others on the team and support collective decision making, or is he or she difficult to work with? 
- Trust. Can you trust this person to keep his or her word and follow through on commitments? 

Company values
One way to determine values is by posing the question: “The rest of you can make all the decisions about the company, as long as...” 
Examples: 
- Care (Give a shit). Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.
- Craft (Master it). Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.
- Team (Work together). Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There’s no such thing as “it’s not my job.”
- Truth (Say it). Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.
- Initiative (Be resourceful). Don’t wait for permission. Figure it out — or figure out who can.
- Fun (Have it). Don’t take yourself too seriously — life is short.

## Six foundations to leadership
- Clarity: communicate goals, strategy and vision over and over 
- Commitment: make sure everyone is in and buys the goals
- Translation: translate the goals, vision strategy to the people within the organization and their day to day activities 
- Enabling: make sure that the people are able to perform their jobs well
- Synergy: people have to get along well
- Accountability: make sure everyone feels accountable (themselves and each other) to the mission, vision and strategy

## Vision
- Vision is something you learn and the best way is to learn from others. Ask those who have been where you want to go. 

## Goal setting 
**Management by Objectives (MBO)**
- Establish unambiguous and realistic objectives.
- Periodically evaluate if objectives are being met.
- Implement corrective action

**OKRs**
Basic process
- Setting vision and goals for the company, each department, and each individual on a regular basis (usually quarterly). 
- Communicating that vision and those goals to every team member. 
- Tracking and reporting progress toward those goals on a regular timetable (usually weekly). 
- Eliciting feedback from all team members on what is going right, and (much more importantly) what is not going right and needs to be changed. 
- Use your Quarterly Goals Meeting to establish near-term actions. Ask yourself: “What actions can we take this week to stay on track for each Quarterly OKR?” Assign each Action to one person. At your next weekly meeting, the first thing you will do is ask everyone to declare if they completed their assigned Action. 
  
Elements
- Objectives are concise and high level - it's like an exciting statement. The Objective answers the question: “Where do we want to go? This objective should tell a compelling story. It does not need to be measurable, but it should be inspiring.
- Key results are easily measurable and lead to achievement of the objective. 'How would we know if we met our objective'? “How do we know that we’re getting there?” KRs should be objectively measurable. Ideally it's a KPI measurement. Otherwise it could be a project completed or for example a survey result. Users are happy vs we measured their satisfaction rate and we reached an average CSAT of 80% and higher. Also make sure that the key results specifically drive business value and avoid that the key results are too tightly related to activities. E.g. don’t say implement Looker but say a BI tool has been implemented 
- OKRs should be difficult to obtain 

## Starting as a manager in an existing team 
As you start your job, critically assess each role and performance. If something doesn’t work, make changes, which can include firing people. Your peers know that someone doesn’t work well and they need you to see the same and make the hard decisions 

Ask your direct reports: 
- What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face) in the near future? 
- Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?
- What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
- What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? 
- If you were me, what would you focus attention on? 
- How can we improve the team works together? 

## Personality types

![Personality Types](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28791247/107872668-bd532700-6ea3-11eb-967a-93caa3f63f51.png)

## Onboarding
Prior to starting: Make others aware of the new hire and make sure everyone knows that the new projects are high priority 

Day 1
- Sit with HR induction
- Set up machine
- Provide high level context and update on status, vision, challenges
- Provide access to tools, set up machine etc. 

Day 2:
- Plan of action and prioritization of projects 
- Introductions to key people in the business
- Schedule in meetings with the key people 
- Start looking at the existing data to get a good grip on how the business works 

Early weeks
- Work on projects that are faily easy to complete, engage with multiple teams and allow learning of the data model 
- Allow lots of time for questions to be asked
- Let them sit in during meetings with stakeholders
- Provide lots of context 
- Be critical around the quality of work expected

## Management when things are hard
The big idea is that we're clear that performance isn't up to the expected level because of specific reasons. Then agree to work towards it. If that doesn't happen, involve more senior people: we need to change or else this may not be the right job for you. Then: 
- Agree clearly on what needs to change 
- Track against what was supposed to change and write things down
- Make sure there is open communication and check ins across the entire team
- If things don’t improve, have an honest chat around whether this role is right at this stage for the person. If it’s not, ideally agree on a form of exit strategy. Aim to do all of this beyond a development plan as those are difficult and painful for everyone involved. 

New notes
Key questions to ask:
- How do you get a group of people to work together on common goals? 
- How do you give people the right amount of responsibility?
- How do you make sure the job gets done?
- How do you do all this with respect for others?

Key tip in managing: always react based on facts. And always ask yourself: what does the next 5 years look like?

CEO’s job is to:
1. Set the vision
2. Raise money
3. Evangelize
4. Hire and manage
5. Set the execution bar/ make sure the entire company executes

Execution:
1. Can you figure out what to do?
2. Can you get it done?

Prioritization is key. What are two or three most important things that need to be done? And get those things done day every day. Trick to good execution: saying no 97 times out of 100. You should not only work very hard, you should be working on the right things.

## Other
**Politics**
Politics are created when someone successfully lobbies the CEO or their manager for some kind of benefit. Others see this, so they in turn lobby. They then gain benefit, and the virus spreads quickly throughout the organization. 
The only way to prevent politics is to never allow lobbying to be successful, and the only way to do this is to have a written policy about as many situations as possible, particularly around compensation, raises, and promotions. Apply this policy to all team members, all the time. 

**Requirements for a good organization**
For an organization to work well, three things must occur at every level of the organization.
1. Accountability 
2. Coaching
3. Transparency

**Accountability** 
Declaring:
- A destination (Vision, OKRs, KPIs)
- The action steps to get there (Actions)
- Whether or not those actions steps were taken (and eventually the destination achieved).

**Coaching** 
Declaring:
- The current health of the entity (individual, team, department, company).  Both the Good and the Not Good.
- With the Not Good, describing in detail what the Issue is, and declaring a Proposed Solution.   (This is where reports can make requests for help from their manager.)

**Transparency** 
Declaring:
- Feedback to people on what they are doing.  This should be to a person’s Manager, Peers,	Reports
- Using the following framework:
  - Like. “These are the specific actions that I like that you are doing.”
  - Wish That. “These are the specific actions that I wish that you would do differently.”

## Firing
If you want to minimize the chance of one of these lawsuits occurring, then create written documentation. A secondary benefit of this documentation is that there is a small chance that the person will begin to perform. Here are the steps: 
1. Create a written PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) that states objective milestones and dates over a 7, 30, 60 and 90 day period. 
2. Meet weekly to check progress against the written milestones. 
3. At 30 days, if he hasn't hit one of the milestones, then you let him go. 
4. At 60 days, the same. 
5. And at 90 days, the same. 

If at any of these stages, the team member does not hit a milestone and you do not fire them, then you have completely invalidated the value of the written document, because you have established a provable pattern that the written document was not meaningful. 
Again, know that there is a very low chance that he will perform. If your team is very small (under 10 people), I recommend simply letting the person go without the PIP. The cost of de-motivating the team is far greater than that of the lawsuit. 

When you do fire someone, put yourself in their shoes. It is a devastating event emotionally. And it is a real setback financially. 

Put real effort into helping the person find their next job, and quickly. Give them a severance package that gives them enough time to realistically find another job and have the pay begin. This is 1 month minimum, but more realistically 2-3 months. And then help them find work within that time-frame. 

It is highly likely that you will be feeling anger toward this person. You will clearly value the rest of your team much more highly than this person. You will not want to give them an extra penny beyond what is required by law (2 weeks). You will want to save those resources for the team that remains that is performing. 

Feel this anger, and then let it pass. Recognize that you have responsibility here. Your recruiting, training and managing helped to create this situation. It is your responsibility to help the person find a job and a company that is a better fit. If you want to save your company’s resources, then help them find that job more quickly. And then turn to your recruiting, training and managing processes, and ask yourself: “What can I do to make sure this doesn’t happen again?”
