# Communication 

## Speaking
- Deep voice
- Speak up 
- Pause for emphasis and for allowing others to jump in 
- Breathe 
- Slow down 
- Articulate 
- Use different tones of pitch (high/low volume, emphasis) 
- Use and, not but 
- Get rid of words like ‘uhmm’. Just pause, think and then move on 
-	Be clear, concise and specific 

General
- Use STAR approach (Situation, Task, Approach, Result)
- Take time before speaking to think things through. 
- Also, make sure you really understand the question and why that person is asking that question. -	Seek for to understand, before being understood. -	To make sure you agree on something, ask probing questions and get it in writing (ideally get them to write it down). Ask them what their understanding of the matter is  

## Helpful tactics
- Repeat the last words someone has said
- Repeating the question
- It can be helpful to let the other person summarize the main points
- “If I understood you correctly, you are saying that”
- “Don’t you think that we should do this and this?”
- “What do you mean?”
- “What do you think?”
- “Really”?
- “Wow, that’s interesting”
- “I see what you mean”
- “Help me understand”
- “Can you tell me more about your views?”



-	Talk to people as if they are the only person in the room



-	When meeting people, think of interesting questions you could ask them (this could become a standard practice when meeting people) 

o	Ask questions. When asking questions, start off by saying what you already know – the others can then correct or fill in gaps 

-	When seeking help (from anyone, really) always start with the goal; this opens you up to a wider range of inputs. So do this instead of asking a very specific question - just because one solution is one of many and rather than focusing on keep doing what you’re doing, you want to get input and understand if there might be an even better way of doing what you are doing 

-	Can you explain your job to someone at a party? 


Ask good questions
Asking good questions gets you a good answer
-	Good questions make it obvious that the person has already done some basic research on their own. If me Googling for half an hour gives the same result as you doing it, it’s not a good question.
-	Good questions are very specific, narrow in scope, and tailored to the person’s area of expertise. Usually you can ask these questions by reading a person’s past blog posts/watching talks/etc. Question: “Can you tell me which data processing library I should use?” Better question: “I see that you’ve given talks on using both Spark on EMR, Hadoop, and even doing data science on your laptop. Do you have one that you prefer if I have 10 TB of data?”
-	Good questions are brief and to the point (respectful of the reader’s time), leaving a call to action as the last part. Often, I’ll get pretty long emails including every single detail that’s not relevant to the question at hand. We’re all super busy and get hundreds of emails. The ones we’re more likely to answer are short and easily-skimmable.



Using DBT Slack
1.	Try to solve a problem before asking for help. 
a.	Check out existing documentation
b.	Google the problem you’re seeing
c.	Debug the issue yourself
i.	target/compiled
ii.	target/run
d.	Experiment - If the question you have is "What happens when I do X", try doing X and see what happens!
2.	Ask your question in the right channel
3.	Ask your question in a way that helps others understand the issue quickly 
 .	Include details - let people know exactly what goes wrong 
 .	Paste the error message or relevant code inside three backticks (```) in your question, instead of sharing a screenshot
i.	Include the version of dbt you’re on (which you can check with dbt --version)
ii.	Let us know which warehouse you’re using
a.	Share the exact code you ran (avoid generalizing it)
b.	Share what you already tried - people are more willing to help knowing that you’ve given something your best shot
c.	Share the context of the problem you’re trying to solve - this might help others understand if there’s an alternative way of thinking about the issue
