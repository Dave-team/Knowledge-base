# Communication 

## Speaking
- Deep voice
- Speak up 
- Pause for emphasis and for allowing others to jump in 
- Breathe deeply
- Slow down 
- Articulate 
- Use different tones of pitch (high/low volume, emphasis) 
- Use and, not but 
- Get rid of words like ‘uhmm’. Just pause, think and then move on 
- Be clear, concise and specific 
- Reduce how quickly and how often you nod
- Pause for two full seconds before you speak.
- Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences.
- Smile

## Helpful tactics
- Repeat the last words someone has said
- Repeating the question
- It can be helpful to let the other person summarize the main points
- “If I understood you correctly, you are saying that”
- “Don’t you think that we should do this and this?”
- “What do you mean?”
- “What do you think?”
- “Really”?
- “Wow, that’s interesting”
- “I see what you mean”
- “Help me understand”
- “Can you tell me more about your views?”

## Asking good questions
- Try to solve the problem prior to asking for help - use debug logs
- Do you own research first - check the documentation and Google the problem
- When you don't have the answer by now - make it an experiment and test things and see what happens
- If you need to ask someone: 
  - Choose who and when to ask: 
    - Is this person too senior for this question?
    - How much time will it take them to answer? If quick, ask now. If longer, schedule a time
    - Find a good time that works
  - Summarize the problem in one specific sentence as the title 
  - First part of answer: expand on the title 
  - Make it obvious that you have done some basic research - the answer shouldn't be found in a quick Google search - State what you already know and then ask "Is that right?"
  - Ask your question in a way that helps others understand the issue quickly 
      - Include details - let people know exactly what goes wrong. E.g. DBT question: which version do you run, which DWH, what is the exact code you tried? Btter too be too detailed than to leave important info out. 
      - Clarify what you have tried already so far and what things you have already thought of 
      - What is the context around the issue - there might be a better way to solve the problem at hand
      - Clarify specifically the end result you'd like to see
      - If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment. This can also include a link of a live example of the problem: e/g/ sqlfiddle. 
- Good questions are very specific, narrow in scope, and tailored to the person’s area of expertise. Usually you can ask these questions by reading a person’s past blog posts/watching talks/etc. Question: “Can you tell me which data processing library I should use?” Better question: “I see that you’ve given talks on using both Spark on EMR, Hadoop, and even doing data science on your laptop. Do you have one that you prefer if I have 10 TB of data?”
- Good questions are brief and to the point (respectful of the reader’s time), leaving a call to action as the last part. Often, I’ll get pretty long emails including every single detail that’s not relevant to the question at hand. We’re all super busy and get hundreds of emails. The ones we’re more likely to answer are short and easily-skimmable.
- When asking questions, start off by saying what you already know – the others can then correct or fill in gaps 
- Always follow up on the answers received 
- Rather than focusing on the issue you're having, describe the goal. The issue you're having might be because you're taking the wrong approach in the first place. 
- Be willing to say what you don’t understand - if someone explains something to do - feel free to stop them and ask "Hey, what does that mean?"
- 

## Asnwering questions good
- If they’re not asking clearly, help them clarify
  - Rephrase a more specific question 
  - Ask them for more specific information 
  - Ask what prompted their question
- Figure out what they know already - “How familiar are you with X?”
- Point them to the documentation where possible. Not only saves time, it will likely also help answer other questions they might have  
- Point them to a useful search - knowing keywords to search aren't always obvious to beginners. “This is the search I’d use to find the answer to that question”
- Write new documentation. If a question comes up more often, write a doc for it and then point them to this doc. 
- Explain what you did. Rather than doing things yourself, walk someone through how they accomplish it. If something is already done, tell them the steps for how you got the answer you gave them (include the things you checked that weren't the problem)
- Solve the underlying problem. People will often be attached to the steps they took so far. But often those steps do not result in the desired outcome. 
- Ask “did that answer your question? Do you have more questions?”. Espeically if given a new documentation, we may simply have forgotten to add some important steps 
- Jump on a call if that's easier - especially when someone is stuck on how to start something

## Emails 
- When sending an email, make it standalone. Make sure that it tells a story that is completely clear for the other party 
- Highlight what's relevant 
- Ask for actions 
- Write to the point of view of the person/people receiving the message

**Email structure**
- Answer first: Summarize the answer/key message/recommendation
- Actions required: List your questions/requests for the reader. Remember:
  - Flag potential roadblocks early so they do not come as a surprise or become too late
  - Always suggest a solution
  - Anticipate future problems
- Next steps: Propose next steps (what, who, when)
- More info: Include relevant background context for future reference

### Email example snippets
- 'I imagine you’re all over this but wanted to double check'
- 'They haven’t yet had a response and because we’re looking to move quite quickly in terms of finalising the set up, I wonder if you are able to give the integration team a nudge on our behalf?  I’ve attached the queries that Joe has for ease of reference – anything you can do would be much appreciated.'
- 'I'd like to start this process sooner than the week we go live as I've found there are unforeseen challenges with integrations and this data will help our reconciliation process. Thank you for the help and let me know the best next steps.'

## Other
- Use STAR approach (Situation, Task, Approach, Result)
- Take time before speaking to think things through. 
- Also, make sure you really understand the question and why that person is asking that question. Seek for to understand, before being understood. To make sure you agree on something, ask probing questions and get it in writing (ideally get them to write it down). Ask them what their understanding of the matter is  
- Put yourself in the position of the other person and try to understand what they want, where they are coming from and what they know. I adept accordingly. 
- Talk to people as if they are the only person in the room
- When meeting people, think of interesting questions you could ask them (this could become a standard practice when meeting people) 
- Don't forget to ask the obvious questions 
- When seeking help (from anyone, really) always start with the goal; this opens you up to a wider range of inputs. So do this instead of asking a very specific question - just because one solution is one of many and rather than focusing on keep doing what you’re doing, you want to get input and understand if there might be an even better way of doing what you are doing 
- Can you explain your job to someone at a party? 
- Think about writing a newspaper article. Write/ say the headline, the subtitle and from there on say the most important stuff. Make sure to eliminate all of the noise that is surrounding.
- When explaining complex things, visualize it with an easy to understand example. Explain your logic step by step. 
- When I'm not in a clear thought process I tend to end what I was saying with 'Yeah'. Instead end withm ‘Does that make sense?’ (especially because you already know your logic wasn't spot on any longer)
- Why / How / What is a good comms approach
- Context should always come first. In standups, don't talk about your status. Take a step back: what is the project? Why are we doing this / what is the So What? What is the approach? Then what is the status?
