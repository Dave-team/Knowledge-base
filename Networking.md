# Networking

## Principles
- Find ways to meet people
    - Go to networking events
    - Reach out cold to people 
    - Ask for an intro via someone you know
- Try to always do something in return. It could be an intro to someone, an interesting book / article
- Always follow up - even if just to say a thank you 
- Connect to the most connected people who can introduce you to many others
- Remember that people like to help and give advice

## Conference tips 
### Preparation and logistics
- Try to understand who is going and who you should catch up with
- Arrive early to avoid dealing with already formed groups. 
- Always have a pitch ready 
- Find someone who looks bored / is on his/her own and introduce yourself 
- Introduce yourself to the people who sit next to you. If it doesn’t work out, move seats 
- When circles have formed, look for the circles with the people you engaged with earlier during the event. Another option is to seek out 1 or 2 people who aren’t really engaged in the conversation and start your own circle that way 
- Make it easy for other people to jump in the conversation. Make a small hole in the circle and once people come by and stand there, introduce yourself. 

### Conversation
- Potential starters: 
    - What brings you here?
    - How are you finding it?
    - What got you interested in X?
- Get contact details and after the event, make sure to follow up. Also add them to LinkedIn and other ways of storing your contacts. 
- Don't stick around with the same people. Have a quick chat, exchange details, say it was nice meeting them and then move on 

## Reaching out to people
- Use a good approach: 
    - Aim for a warm intro
    - If that's not possible, options include LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack, messaging boards, Meetup pages
- Be specific about what they have done and relate that to something interesting you are doing yourself. Find something you have in common. A good excuse for reaching out is because someone recommend you to reach out (make sure the other person is a mutual connection)  
- Ask specifically for something:
    - Have an agenda for what you want to discuss (i.e. the opposite of ‘picking their brain’)
    - How long will it take?
    - When?
    - The goal is to be respectful of the reader’s time and it should be easy to act on 
- Follow up 
    - For example you found a job, reach out and thank them. 
    - Ask them if they know anyone else that might know about the topic and are worth chatting with. 
    - Ask what you can do for them
    - What you can do if e.g. give a recommendation of a book/article, or an introduction to someone in your network

I can imagine you have similar challenges (e.g., interfacing with stakeholders and deciding on the generalist vs specialist model). Happy to work around your schedule and come to you. Let me know when works best.
