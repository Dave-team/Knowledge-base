# Mindfullness

## Definition 
“Mindfulness” is a practice of learning to stay in the present moment and observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Accepting our experiences and thoughts without making judgments about them. 

Being mindful is to be aware of our experience, moment-to-moment, in a quite particular way, with curiosity, with kindness and with care and without judgement and without labelling.

As you watch your thoughts, you realize how many of them are fear based. The moment you recognize a fear, without even trying it goes away. After a while, your mind quiets. When your mind quiets, you stop taking everything around you for granted. You start to notice the details. You think, “Wow, I live in such a beautiful place. It’s so great that I have clothes, and I can go to Starbucks and get a coffee anytime. Look at these people—each one has a perfectly valid and complete life going on in their own heads.” It pops us out of the story we’re constantly telling ourselves. If you stop talking to yourself for even ten minutes, if you stop obsessing over your own story, you’ll realize we are really far up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and life is pretty good. 

## Why it matters
- “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself”
- “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.”
- You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf.
- Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.
- We’re in a constant race for the next thing. When we try to do exactly nothing, we can’t do it, because there’s anxiety always trying to make you get up and go, get up and go, get up and go. This anxiety is making you unhappy. The anxiety is just a series of running thoughts. Once we do complete something, we never take the moment to recognize and celebrate what we've accomplished because there's more to do. Once we practice cultivating a sense of completeness more, you could better cope with the mind telling you you're not there yet, not yet fulfilled. You might learn that you are complete, whole, just as you are.
- Our minds always try to summarize things. Once we reached a summary - we assume that interpretation to be true. Once we reached these overgeneralized conclusions, we rarely go back to the event and consider alternative scenarios. 
- We try so hard to be happy that we end up missing the most important parts of our lives and destroying the very peace that we were seeking.
- The present is all we have: There is actually nothing but this moment. No one has ever gone back in time, and no one has ever been able to successfully predict the future in any way that matters.
- We crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.
- The effort of freeing ourselves from unhelpful thoughts or moods often makes things worse because you start from a state that you are feeling 'wrong' and 'should be' feeling different. We may also remember past regrets and future worries, digging the hole further. The more you strrugle, the deeper you sink. Instead, accept, be aware and be curious. We'll see that the thoughts then fade automatically. These things aren't problems to be solved - they are emotions that only can be felt. Once you’ve felt them – that is, acknowledged their existence –  and let  go of the tendency to explain or get rid of them (accepting things as they are), they are much more likely to  vanish naturally, like the mist on a spring morning. it’s often far easier and more effective in the long run to live with our difficulties than to pour resources into battling and suppressing them.

## Benefits of mindfullness 
- To increase awareness and control thought by establishing a deep connection with my mind 
- When we pay attention to how we are thinking and feeling right now, we become better at spotting the build up of uncomfortable emotions and thoughts – so that we can deal with them more effectively, instead of just reacting in ways that might not be good for us.
- We learn that thoughts are just thoughts. They are not facts, they don't define me and they don't represent reality. They are your running commentary on the world. We can choose whether to give them power over our minds and hearts. They come and then they leave again.
- You will eventually be able to see more clearly that some things in life are less important than you had thought, and find it easier to let go of over-caring about them. You will find that the energy that they have been consuming can be used to treat yourself and the world more generously.
- By practicing mindfullness in good times we're better able to control situations when the going gets tough. 
- To be more present / in the moment day to day. To make us curious about the world again and to appreciate the small things with mindfulness that we usually take for granted and to truly be present. Just think of all the pleasures of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching that are drifting by you unnoticed. We need to relearn how to bring awareness to everyday activities so that you can see life as it is, unfolding moment by moment. 
- To increase concentration and focus for longer
- To be more effective in my thoughts about work and to realize in better fashion what the right thing to do is and not let my decisions be influenced by an autopilot or distorted mind. 
- The first thing to realize is you can observe your mental state. Meditation doesn’t mean you’re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. 
- Let's you refocus on what matters. Taking a breather before going on autopilot makes me consider what I actually want to do next. And if I then do something first that breaks the autopilot old habits, I may find that I really enjoy it. Being aware that it’s your old routines appealing. Be aware that it’s your autopilot. Recognise that you want to do the thing but hold off doing it until it comes natural
- Able to be fully aware in the moment and do exactly what needs to be done on that thing I'm working on. 

**How mindfulness changes the brain**
- Enlarges the prefrontal cortex. This area of the brain is associates with higher order brain functions such as awareness, concentration and decision-making
- Shrinks the amygdala. The amygdala is a key brain structure known as the emotional or fear center of the brain. Smaller amygdalae found in more mindful people are associated with greater emotional control. People less trained in mindfulness are more prone to negative emotions and panic attacks as their amygdala is on high alert all the time. 

## Mindfullness principles
- Make a commitment to practice it. It requires discipline whilst approaching it with compassion. It will feel difficult at first but we need to keep at it to reap the benefits as the benefits will not appear initially. It's like a garden where we plant seeds and nourish them to allow them to grow as plants. And we need to continue to water them. 
- To keep at it: remember why we're doing it in the first place - refer back to the benefits and remind yourself of the benefits regularly. 
- Make it a habit – e.g. first thing in the morning and have a determined place where you meditate
- Reflect not on future when there are more immediate things to reflect on
- One thing to realize here is that you are not in control of your thinking. You are simply an observer to whatever happens and whatever your mind produces
- Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way. Don't try to sleep until you consciously relaxed body and breathing. 
- The practice of mindfulness is to be aware and then just start again. There is no goal and we will always be distracted by thoughts

## Types of mindfullness practices
**Walking mindfulness**
- Look around and observe sights, sounds and smells. Can you feel the pavement through your shoes? The movement of the muscles in your feet and legs? Can you taste or smell the air? Can you feel it moving through your hair and caressing your skin? See if it is possible to be open to all your senses: smell the scent of flowers, the aroma of freshly cut grass, the mustiness of winter leaves or, perhaps, the smell of exhaust fumes and fastfood; see if you can feel the breeze on your face or the rain on your head or hands; listen to the air as it moves; see how the patterns of light and shade can shift unexpectedly. Look at the architecture. Look at the trees and their form, colour? Think about what they went trough and withstood. 
- When in nature, what can help being mindful is to understand the trees, the appearance and sounds of birds. 
- Notice the actual sensations of walking 
- Count the colours you’re seeing - spot the shades of green 
- Notice whether people wear jeans etc. 

**Waking breaths**
Start the day with mindfulness When you open your eyes, gently pause before taking five deliberate breaths. 

**Cooking and eating meditation**
- Preparing food: vision, hearing, smell, touch. Feel the knife slicing the veg, smell the veg as its being chopped. 
- Eating: colours, shapes, how this food came to you, the sensations of eating. 
  - Rewally look at the food. What do you see? Look at all the little details as if it's the first time you ever see something like it.
  - Smell the food. What do you smell? What does it remind you off? 
  - Touching (e.g. raisin): what does it feel like - how is the texture?
  - Pop the food in your mouth. What are the sensations of having it on your tongue? Then take a bit - what happens to the food as you bite? What is the texture like? What tastes can you detect? Try to slow down the swallowing and chew for a while. What does the fourth mouthful taste like?
  - Sawllowing: notice how the body prepares for the actual movement of swallowing. What does the tongue do? Can you feel the food go down to the stomach? 
  - Aftermath: is there an aftertaste? Is there an automatic desire for more? 
  - How does this feel? Different? Do you taste more now? 
- Washing dishes: try and feel the water, the plates, and the fluctuating sensations in your hands, the temperature, rinsing movements. 

**Daily activities**
- Being fully engaged in activity. Do these things with present moment awareness, interest and care. 
  - brushing teeth: where is your mind? How does the toothbrush go over teeth? Flavour of toothpaste, moisture building up in the mouth 
  - taking a shower: pay attention to the sensations of water on the body, the temperature and the pressure. The movements of the hands and the body. If we decide to plan the day ahead, do so intentionally. 
- Purposefully engaging in activity. Focus on something and describe it in as much detail as possible. How it feels, looks, tastes, sounds. From all different angles in different contexts. And don't judge it - when listening to raindrops, focus on how the sounds are distinguishable rather than directly qualifying them as raindrops.
- Spend more time on nourishing than depleting activities; for those activities that need doing, approach them with more mindfulness rather than judging them or wishing them away. And take small pauses before and after these activities 
- A big part of the daily activities is to also break things down into chunks rather than seeing them as big projects that need to be planned for and executed at once, perfectly. 

**Breathing spaces**
- Regularly taking a pause from what we're doing and tune into our breathing, our senses, our moods how our bodies feel.
- Fundamentally, we ask ourselves 3 questions: 
  - What do you feel in your body? 
  - What’s going on in your mind? 
  - What’s your emotional state like? 
- This allows us then to take much more conscious decisions around what we want to do next - it's important to take this pause rather than just continueing where we left off. This need not be productive in a business sense, or even in a personal sense, but should be something that just feels right and appropriate. It should not be impulsive or habitual but, rather, an activity that will actively enhance your life. Often, the best course of action is nothing and let things take care of themselves. 
- Three options as to taking next steps: 
  - Doing something pleasurable. Over time, we can stop to enjoy things as we're too occupied being busy. Instead, we want to try things we believe we might enjoy to activate these neurons again. E.g. a bath, a snack, a nice drink, a conversation with a friend, a walk, a hobby, reading, movies, music, excercise etc. Don't wait until you feel like doing these things, do them anyway - the action is a meditation in itself, an opportunity for learning and exploring our reactions and responses. Reclaim your life. 
  - Doing something that will give a sense of satisfaction or mastery over life. Make this small - tackle it and then celebrate the achievement. It can be doing some chores, cleaning, practicing a skill you'd like to learn, do a random act of kindness. How can you make the life of family, friends, lover and even strangers a little bit better? Don't wait until you feel like doing it. 
  - Continue to act mindfully. what do your eyes see, your ears hear, your nose smell? What can you touch? What is your posture, your facial expression? What is right here, if you take a moment of mindful awareness? Whatever you are doing, mindfulness is only one breath away. It is as easy as focusing your entire attention solely on what you are already doing right now.In this way, see if it is possible to bring your mind to each present moment, for example:‘ Now I am standing in the queue... Now I can feel the basket in my hand...Now I’m walking forwards...Now I’m reaching fo rmy bag...’Beaware of your breathing as you do other things; be aware of the contact of your feet with the floor as you stand and as you walk. The tiny things we do can change how we feel completely. A short walk, ten minutes of reading or a cup of tea can change a whole lot. 

Step 1: become aware
- Deliberately change posture. 
- Bring your awareness to your inner experience and acknowledge it, asking: what is my experience right now?
  - What thoughts are going through the mind? As best you can, acknowledge thoughts as mentalevents.
  - What feelings are here? Turn towards any sense of discomfort or unpleasant feelings, acknowledging them without trying to make them different from how you find them.
  - What body sensations are here right now? Perhaps quickly scan the body to pick up any sensations of tightness or bracing, acknowledging the sensations, but, once again, not trying t ochange them in any way.

Step 2: gathering and focusing attention
Now, redirecting the attention to a narrow ‘spotlight’ on the physical sensations of the breath, move in close to the physical sensations of the breath in the abdomen...expanding as the breath comes in ...and falling back as the breath goes out. Follow the breath all the way in and all the way out. Use each breath as an opportunity to anchor yourself into the present. And if the mind wanders, gently escort the attention back to the breath.

Step 3: expanding attention
Now, expand the field of awareness around the breathing so that it includes a sense of the body as a whole, your posture and facial expression, as if the whole body was breathing. If you become aware of any sensations of discomfort or tension, feel free to bring your focus of attention right in to the intensity by imagining that the breath could move into and around the sensations. In this, you are helping to explore the sensations, befriending them,rather than trying to change them in any way.If they stop pulling for your attention, return to sitting, aware of the whole body, moment by moment.

Step 4: relating differently to your thoughts. 

**Pure awareness**
- Relax, look around you and just sit. Be amazed at how beautiful things are. How far we’ve come in our lives and in the universe and be grateful. Look at the color of the walls and the materials they're made of - how did we get this far? 
- If you don’t look at things through your concepts, you’ll never be bored. We need to unlearn. Spend hours observing the simplest things for what they really are. 
- Slow down and taste and smell and hear, let your senses come alive. Be satisfied with very little and enjoy it intensely. You’d be amazed how great things can get. 

**Appreciation and gratitude**
- Pause appreciate and reflect on what we have and have done. Appreciate beauty and immerse on the moment whatever you do
- List 10 things your grateful for. This is hard but we aim for quite a few as that brings awareness to the tiny unnoticed things we otherwise take for granted. 

**Embrace boredome**
- Part of it is to fully embrace possible boredom 

**Meditation**
- Meditation. Meditation is a way of cultivating mindfulness. 

**Smile**
- Smile. You won't feel anxious when smiling. 

**Excercise**
Breathe with, and into, their intensity.

**Breath**
Any single breath is a new awakening. Just take a few mindful breaths regularly. 

**Sounds meditation**
After having become familiar with the body and breath, shift the focus of attention to any sounds as they arise. Just be receptive. Be aware of them as raw sounds without attaching a label to them - be aware of their sensory qualities (pitch, loundness, duration) rather than their meanings. 

## Dealing with thoughts
- They will come and they provide the exact practice towards the benefits we want to achieve. The whole practice is to realize you're wondering and then coming back. This is the resistance training needed to enhance our awareness. 
- Don’t try and fight it, just notice them and be aware that you’re out of control. This awareness alone can calm you down. 
- When thoughts arise, let them flow by. Do not engage with them. I am not my thoughts - they are merely things that flow by. No need to try and change them - accept them as they're already there. 
- Go in debugging mode. Ask yourself: “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” Because as long as I have my thoughts, I can’t have my peace. “Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself? Who cares? I’m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero, and I won’t remember anything, so this is pointless.” “Do I really need to solve this problem right now?” Ninety-five percent of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don’t need to tackle in that exact moment. If the brain is like a muscle, I’ll be better off resting it, being at peace
- I’m actually going back to my awareness level of OS, which is always calm, always peaceful, and generally happy and content. I’m trying to stay in awareness mode and not activate the monkey mind, which is always worried, frightened, and anxious. It serves incredible purpose, but I try not to activate the monkey mind until I need it. When I need it, I want to just focus on that. If I run it 24/7, I waste energy and the monkey mind becomes me. I am more than my monkey mind.

## Our minds 
**Thinking Mind / Doing Mind**
- Thoughts will always continue to pop up. We can't control the Thinking Mind. The trick is to not fuse and identify with the those as they come up. Instead of saying, “I am nervous,” say, “I feel nervousness." Disidentify and then take possession of strong thoughts. Disidentifying from these emotions and thoughts in this way does two things:
  - implies that they’re temporary states, and not permanent conditions;
  - forces you to take responsibility for them. They’re nobody’s fault, they just are.
- We can also thank our negative emotions. It will diminish the power of the thoughts and emotions and impels to take action despite them. “Thank you, Thinking Mind, for feeling nervous before my date tonight. It will keep me on my toes!”
- When people come to me ask how to “stop feeling angry,” or “stop getting nervous,” this is their problem: As soon as you try to eliminate a thought or emotion, you make it stronger. As the Buddhist saying goes: “What you resist will persist.” Negative emotions are like quicksand, the more you struggle to get out of them, the further into them you sink.
-  I feel the same fear and worry anyone else does, I just don’t identify with it. I accept it and move on despite it. I don’t let my Thinking Mind control me. I defuse from my emotions. When I feel fear, I consciously choose to act despite it. When I feel worry, I consciously choose to act despite it.
- Our thinking mind tries to solve problems all the time. By thinking, judging, planning and trawling through past memories while searching for solutions. A lot of problems however can't be solved or they don't need to be solved now. When you are caught in a trap of solving problems, return to awareness and just 'being'. We cannot solve feelings and we cannot solve the future and we cannot solve the past. 

**Being Mind**
- This part of the brain is aware, relaxed and in the present moment. It is developed through mindfulness excercise 
- We are capable of directly sensing things like the sounds of birds, the scent of beautiful flowers and the sight of a loved one’s smile.
- This mode responds to impulses from the Thinking Mind

## Meditation

### Preparation
- Set your intention for the session and focus on what's coming. Treat it as a workout and a learning session. Don’t expect anything and just see what happens

### Types of meditation
**Nonjudgmental Awareness**. As you’re going about your daily business, you practice learning to accept the moment you’re in without making judgments. You don’t judge anything. You just accept everything. 

**Transcendental meditation**: using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. 

**Naval meditation**
- Each morning, give you yourself a break from life for one hour. Close your eyes and say, “I’m just going to give myself a break for an hour. This is my hour off from life. This is the hour I’m not going to do anything. Why can you not do anything for an hour? What’s so hard about giving yourself an hour-long break? 
- Sit somewhere comfortably and shut your eyes for one hour 
- Thoughts will come. Don’t resist them and don’t work with them. Just observe them - whatever happens, happens. Don't put effort into it, don't put effort against it - just surrended in the moment. Meditation is not going through thoughts but rather letting thoughts go through you.
- They will come out one by one, and you will be forced to deal with them. Resolving them doesn’t take any work—you just observe them.
- What will happen is that all of your life will eventually fly you by and you will have given most things a place in your mind. If you do 60 days 60 minutes meditation, eventually you should reach inbox 0 in your mind. This is when you no longer have any ‘issues’ to deal with in your mind. It’s a state of joy and bliss and peace. Once you have it, you don’t want to give it up. If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning just by sitting and closing your eyes, that is worth its weight in gold. It will change your life. After about sixty days, you will be tired of listening to your own mind. You will have resolved a lot of issues, or you have heard them enough to see through those fears and issues.

#### Standard meditation
**Process**
- Sit on floor/chair/cushion with muscles relaxed and back straight 
- Close my eyes
- Perform a few deep and slow breaths with the purpose of losing the body and relax the muscles
- Notice the sensations throughout the body – warmth, cold, discomfort, etc. Notice the contact with whatever we sit or lie on. Be aware but don’t dwell on them 
- Body Scan: Spend awareness in the different parts of the body: toes to head. What are the physical sensations? For example toes touching one another, tingling, warmth, numbness. If there aren't any - register a blank. A good aim is 30 seconds on each part of the body. If there is tension, try to breath into that sensation. After that, see if you can be aware of feelings across the entire body. 
- Breath: Breath normally, possibly with a short pause between the in and out breath. Focus here on bodily sensations related to the breath – around the nose, face, mouth, chest, abdomen. Take your time to get used to these feelings. Try to notice all physical sensations relating to the breath. Perhaps put your heads on the abdominal to feel their changing patterns throughout the breath.  
- Start paying attention to the meditation object – the sensation of the breath. Focus on only the area where the sensations are the clearest – e.g. around the nostrils. Do no longer follow the rhythm of the breath. While you pay attention to the object, your peripheral awareness remains relaxed and open to anything that arises. 

**Distractions**
- Be aware of the distraction
    - What is it?
    - How strong is it?
    - How long does it last?
- Realize that distractions are fine - don't force anything. Notice them, then slowly return to the breath. Let it come, let it be, let it go 
- If distracted, it’s always important to go back to normal breathing first before focusing on the meditation object to get back in the flow 
- You may name the distractions: 'here's panning/thinking/worrying' and then bring awareness back to the breath. 

**Mind wandering solutions**
- Count the breaths, e.g. one at a time, or 1-10 on each in and exhale in rapid succession. Or else 1-1-1-1 in, then 2-2-2-2 ex, and so further. The goal is to keep track of the count and e.g. reach 10. When the mind wanders of, start again at 0. The mind will wander, just don’t lose complete track of the breath or the counting. Once you’ve reached 10 without issues, stop counting and just focus on the breath. 
- Take some more deep breaths
- Use "in-out" instead of counting the breaths

### 10 stages to meditation
1. Spend time daily to actively and wholeheartedly meditate 
2. Keeping the attention on the breath. This mainly consist of getting back to the breath when the mind starts wandering. The opposite is forgetting to get back to the breath, which is when meditation just doesn’t really work. The aim is to reduce the amount of time you spend mind wandering and focus the time spend on the meditation object
3.  Extending the period of attention and reduce the forgetting of getting back to the breath. Here, you start focusing on introspective attention as well – which is essentially become really aware of what is happening in your mind 

By the end of the 3rd stage, you’ve reached the first Milestone and are no longer a beginner. Now you can continuous attention to the meditation object without wind wandering or forgetting

4. Continuous attention and overcoming distraction and dullness – the breath is still main focus point and just focussing on the breath doesn’t lead to dullness
5. Get rid of subtle dullness essentially by doing even more introspective mindfulness work 
6. Single pointed attention to the meditation object

Second milestone reached: you can now focus on the breath without being distracted by the background and you aware of your state of mind in every moment 

7. Sustained and exclusive attention to any object but still havening to put in the effort 

Milestone 3: effortless stability of attention 

8. The only limitation is in how far you can physically stay in the same position 
9. No longer is your physical position a showstopper
10. When the mind is pretty much in meditative state even when not meditating 

Milestone 4: mastery of meditation
