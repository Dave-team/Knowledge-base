# Stoicism
- You can only be happy when you love the process. Happiness is not at the other end of something. Some people have experienced extreme hardships, but once the initial blow of the hardship is over, they tend to be just as happy again as ‘we’ are. 
- Also focus on providing impact. When you miss your flight, that’s shit. How can you use this to your advantage? Read that book, call that person, etc
- Only focus on what you can control
- Even for the things we don't control, we still control our response to these things 

The philosophy asserts that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and judgment be based on behavior, rather than words. That we don’t control and cannot rely on external events, only ourselves and our responses.

But at the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple, though not easy, way of living. Take obstacles in your life and turn them into your advantage, control what you can and accept what you can’t.
