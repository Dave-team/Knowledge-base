# Stoicism

## Have a philosophy of life 
- We need to know what we want out of life so we can live according to it. We need a philosophy of life. Otherwise, we are at our deathbed and realize we wasted our chance at living. Instead of spending your life pursuing something genuinely valuable, you squandered it because you allowed yourself to be distracted by the various baubles life has to offer.

## Be content with what we have 
- We are in a satisfaction treadmill: we work hard to get what we want. When we get it, it doesn't deliver the expected happiness and we lose interest in the object we so desired. We get bored and chase greater desires. Once we fulfil a desire for something, they adapt to its presence in their life and as a result stop desiring it—or at any rate, don’t find it as desirable as they once did. They end up just as dissatisfied as they were before fulfilling the desire.
- We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking for granted, once we get them, the things we worked so hard to get. We need a technique for creating within ourselves a desire for the things we already have. The easiest way to gain happiness is to be happy with the things we already have 
- To tame our tendency to always want more is to persuade ourselves to want the things we already have 
- You can only be happy when you love the process. Happiness is not at the other end of something. Some people have experienced extreme hardships, but once the initial blow of the hardship is over, they tend to be just as happy again as ‘we’ are. 

## Focus on what we can control, let go of the rest
- Focus on what you can control and don’t even think about what you can’t control 
- Life is a game we’re in. Although we don’t control everything we choose to play to the best of our ability

## Reflect on life 
- We will become a more thoughtful observer of our own life. We will watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and will later reflect on what we saw, trying to identify the sources of distress in our life and thinking about how to avoid that distress.
- A good time to reflect on our life is while laying in bed waiting for sleep to come 

## Enjoy life, but don't take it for granted
- Stoics think people should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, they thought we should periodically interrupt our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever it is we are enjoying.
- The Stoics enjoyed whatever “good things” happened to be available, but even as they did so, they prepared themselves to give up the things in question.
- we must be ready to give up the good things without regret if our circumstances should change.

## Overcoming hardship and challenges 
- The difficulties we experience are a way of hardening ourselves and making us more fit for purpose
- “Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness—all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.”
- Get out of your comfort zone often to overcome fears. This way, you prelude many fears and anxiety you will have later in your life. “Compared to this what I did back then, this new challenge is nothing” However, it’s important to consistently get out of the comfort zone 

## Achieving goals
- When wanting to achieve big goals, focus on achieving small tasks really well consistently. 

## Techniques
### Negative visualization 
- Any thoughtful person will periodically (at least a few times a week) contemplate the bad things that can happen to him. The obvious reason for doing this is to prevent those things from happening. If we think about these things, we will lessen their impact on us when, despite our efforts at prevention, they happen
- Negative visualization is spending time imagining that we have lost the things we value—that our wife has left us, our car was stolen, or we lost our job. Doing this, the Stoics thought, will make us value our wife, our car, and our job more than we otherwise would. Negative visualization teaches us to embrace whatever life we happen to be living and to extract every bit of delight we can from it. But it simultaneously teaches us to prepare ourselves for changes that will deprive us of the things that delight us. It teaches us, in other words, to enjoy what we have without clinging to it. It can make you realize, if only for a time, how lucky you are—how much you have to be thankful for, almost regardless of your circumstances.
- “We should love all of our dear ones . . . , but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.” While enjoying the companionship of loved ones, then, we should periodically stop to reflect on the possibility that this enjoyment will come to an end. If nothing else, our own death will end it. Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this might be our final parting. If we do this, we will be less likely to take our friends for granted, and as a result, we will probably derive far more pleasure from friendships than we otherwise would.
- We should periodically pause to reflect on the fact that we will not live forever and therefore that this day could be our last. Such reflection will make us appreciate how wonderful it is that we are alive and have the opportunity to fill this day with activity. This in turn will make it less likely that we will squander our days. When the Stoics counsel us to live each day as if it were our last, their goal is not to change our activities but to change our state of mind as we carry out those activities. In particular, they don’t want us to stop thinking about or planning for tomorrow; instead they want us, as we think about and plan for tomorrow, to remember to appreciate today
- Besides contemplating the loss of our life, we should contemplate the loss of our possessions. Most of us spend our idle moments thinking about the things we want but don’t have. We would be much better off to spend this time thinking of all the things we have and reflecting on how much we would miss them if they were not ours. Along these lines, we should think about how we would feel if we lost our material possessions, including our house, car, clothing, pets, and bank balance; how we would feel if we lost our abilities, including our ability to speak, hear, walk, breathe, and swallow; and how we would feel if we lost our freedom
- I never eally considered what I would miss - what would happen if I let go or something happens? What am I left with? Always think about that - partly that makes you appreciate each moment, it makes you care more and makes you more attractive. It also means that when you lose something you did all you can to make it work and ideally you wouldn’t actually completely fall into a hole

### The dichotomy of control: on becoming invincible 
- Triage of control: those we have no control over, those we have complete control over, and those we have some but not complete control over.
- Spending time over things we have no control is a waste as we cannot impact the outcome. Instead, we should spend some of our time dealing with things over which we have complete control, such as our goals and values, and spend most of our time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control.
- Things we completely control include: 
  - The goals we set for ourselves 
  - Our values
  - Our character
- To get what we want, we should want things that are easy to obtain and we can be certain of obtaining 
- Whenever we desire something that is not up to us, our tranquillity will likely be disturbed: If we don’t get what we want, we will be upset, and if we do get what we want, we will experience anxiety in the process of getting it.
- Goals are often things we have some, but not complete over (e.g. winning a tennis match). We should internalize these goals: the goal is not to win a tennis match (you don’t fully control that). The goal is to play to the very best of your own ability 
- Also focus on providing impact. When you miss your flight, that’s shit. How can you use this to your advantage? Read that book, call that person, etc
- Even for the things we don't control, we still control our response to these things 

### Fatalism: Letting go of the past and present 
- There is the past, present and future. We can either spend this moment wishing in the past wishing things were different, or we can embrace this moment, or we can be anxious about the future about things we don't control (which is almost everything in the future). If we live in the past, we will spend much of our life in a state of dissatisfaction, if we live in the future we live in a constant state of anxiety. Only if we live in the present, we will enjoy our life.
- We must learn to adapt ourselves to the environment into which fate has placed us and do our best to love the people with whom fate has surrounded us. We must learn to welcome whatever falls to our lot and persuade ourselves that whatever happens to us is for the best. Indeed, according to Marcus, a good man will welcome “every experience the looms of fate may weave for him."

### Self denial: On dealing with the dark side of pleasure 
- Besides contemplating bad things happening (negative visualization), we should sometimes live as if they had happened. Learn what you can live without. Most things really aren’t needed. Do this by actually living without these things. Sometimes, we need to experience discomfort. E.g. underdress when it’s cold – allow yourself to be thirsty or hungry. Sleep on a hard bed. Pass on pleasures such as drinking wine. Practice poverty. 
- This way, we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befall us in the future and grow confident that we can overcome most things. It’ll also help us appreciate what we already have.

### Meditation: Watching ourselves practice stoicism 
- Seneca advises that we periodically meditate on the events of daily living, how we responded to these events, and how, in accordance with Stoic principles, we should have responded to them. We can also go through a mental checklist to see if we’ve practicing stoicism as it’s meant to be practised 
- We should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reflect on how we responded to the day’s events. How did we respond to an insult? To the loss of a possession? To a stressful situation? Did we, in our responses, put Stoic psychological strategies to work? 

## Stoic advise
### Duty: On loving mankind
- Man is supposed to be social and rational 

### Social relations: On dealing with other people 
- Form a certain character and pattern when alone. When associating with others, use that character
- Seek to befriend people can enjoy companionship with and who we can learn from 
- Marcus recommends that when we interact with an annoying person, we keep in mind that there are doubtless people who find us to be annoying. More generally, when we fi nd ourselves irritated by someone’s shortcomings, we should pause to reflect on our own shortcomings. Doing this will help us become more empathetic to this individual’s faults and therefore become more tolerant of him. When dealing with an annoying person, it also helps to keep in mind that our annoyance at what he does will almost invariably be more detrimental to us than whatever it is he is doing. In other words, by letting ourselves become annoyed, we only make things worse.
- Don’t worry about the little things: remind ourselves that this mortal life endures but a moment 

### Insults: On putting up with put-downs 
- If an insult is true, no reason to be upset. Why is it an insult to be told what is self evident? 
- Think about how well informed the insulter is. He might say something that is wrong or something from his viewpoint. Rather than being angry, we should set him straight 
- Consider the source of an insult. If it’s from someone you respect, it’s not an insult. E.g. when criticized by a piano teacher we shouldn’t feel insulted 
- Often, those who insult us have deeply flawed characters. In that case, these people deserve our pity 
- The more we practice stoicism the less we care for the opinions of others. We don’t live for the approval of others 
- What upsets people is not the things themselves but their judgements of these things 
- Reply to insults:
  - With humor: for example self depreciating – state that things are actually much worse then what you got insulted for 
  - By not responding at all: we don’t have time for this 

### Grief: On vanishing tears with reason 
- Best grief prevention strategy is negative visualization. We remove the shock and by contemplating their death, we make the most out of the relationship. Then, when they die we don’t regret not having most of the relationship 
- Rather than mourning, we should be thankful of the relationship we had with the person. This is retrospective negative visualization: we imagine never having had something we lost  
- The person who died wouldn’t want us to grieve 
- Grief to some extend is a form of living in the past 
- What are you grieving about? It’s often selfish – it’s personal loss, personal regrets. You feel sorry for what you’ll now be missing – which also shows that you dependent to some thing on what is now lost. 

### Anger: On overcoming anti-joy 
- If we are overly sensitive, we will be quick to anger. More generally, says Seneca, if we coddle ourselves, if we allow ourselves to be corrupted by pleasure, nothing will seem bearable to us, and the reason things will seem unbearable is not because they are hard but because we are soft. Seneca therefore recommends that we take steps to ensure that we never get too comfortable. 
- Thus, when we feel ourselves getting angry about something, we should pause to consider its cosmic (in)significance. Doing this might enable us to nip our anger in the bud.
- Anger management: 	
  - When angry, relax our face, soften our voice and slow our pace of walking
  - Buddhist: when angry, think a positive thought. E.g. when angry, think about love 
- One of the worst things we can do when other people annoy us is get angry. The anger will, after all, be a major obstacle to our tranquillity. 
- Anger, in other words, resembles a mosquito bite: It feels bad not to scratch a bite and feels good to scratch it. The problem with mosquito bites, of course, is that after you scratch one, you typically wish you hadn’t done so: The itch returns, intensified, and by scratching the bite, you increase the chance that it will become infected. Much the same can be said of anger: Although it feels good to vent it, you will probably subsequently regret having done so

## Personal values 
- To have freedom we must be indifferent to what others think of us 
- Not needing wealth is more valuable than wealth itself
- Enjoy life in taking delight in the small easily obtainable things 
- Instead of trying to become popular, we worked to maintain and improve our relationships with those we knew to be true friends.
