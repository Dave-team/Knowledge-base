# Human behaviour
- People behave differently primarily because of their different in their environment and life experiences. This makes it very hard to understand people’s behaviour 
- People are status seeking 
- Poeple care about what others think of them 
- People spend a lot of time comparing themselves to others. 
- People don’t like risks 
- People are naturally lazy so unless a level of pain is large enough, they’ll always prefer to do nothing 
- We are driven by a need to avoid pain and gain pleasure 
- We repeat what we get rewarded for and avoid activities we get punished for
- The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated
