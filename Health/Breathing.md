# Breathing

## Breathing tips
- Relax. A relaxed body on an empty stomach absorbs more oxygen
- Feel. Don’t get too hung up on counting, feel how your body responds
- Observe. Record your thoughts and retention times (but remember it’s not a competition)
- Always aim to breath in via the nose - even while running 

## Wim Hof method
- Step 1: Get Comfortable
- Step 2: Start to breathe. Fully in (nose/mouth) then let go (mouth), continuously, 30-40 times
- Step 3: Last breath - breathe out, emptying the lungs. Hold for as long as you can (no force)
- Step 4: After the hold, take a deep breath in and hold for 10-15 seconds
- Step 5: Repeat the entire process for another 2 or 3 rounds

## 5-7-8
Breath in for 4 seconds through the nose quietly. Hold for 7 seconds. Out for 8 seconds loudly. Do this 4 times. E.g. do it just after waking up and just before sleep
