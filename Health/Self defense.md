# Self defense
- Focus on escaping the situation. You never know if they carry a gun or a knife – it can be in their sleeve and you might not even notice it 
- If you can’t escape, the second option is to be completely calm and try to talk to them 
- The hardest part of street fights is that someone is coming at you wild and with a lot of anger and energy. At that point, your brain will most likely not remember what you’ve learned 
- When you don’t or can’t run away:
- Keep enough distance from your opponent and don’t get hit. Missing shots will tire them out 
- Make sure to hit the vulnerable places
    - Crotch
    - Chest
    - Eyes
    - Nose
    - Ears
    - Knees
    - Ankles
- Be even crazier than your opponent – scare them off
