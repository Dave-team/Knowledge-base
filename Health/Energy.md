# Engery
## General
- Aim to have energy after work. It's often not because of our mental energy we put into work, it's because of how we've done it. A measure of success is how tired we are NOT at the end of the day. Tiredness comes from stress, tension, worry and frustation. 
- Rest is recharge and repaid - not doing nothing
