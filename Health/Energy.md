## How to minimize tiredness
**Approach work calm**
We tend to not be tired because of how much we do, but how we do it. Tension, stress, worry and frustation cause mental fatigue. The best solution therefore is to remain calm during the day - meditation and mindful breaks can help. In addition, don't purely sprint at work where I do a 3 hour nonstop highly productive session. We can only be productive for so long in a day. Doing a big sprint will cause tiredness earlier (before end of day). Instead, work according to the Pomodoro technique - work on something for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. Think of this as recharging to have a more productive overall day, not as doing nothing. 

**Diet**
Drink lots of water during the day. 
Decrease carbs, increase fats. 
Eat more fruits and vegetables.
Regular healthy snacks that keep a consistent flow of energy?

**Change of scenery**
Go for a walk outside - also gives fresh air and sunlight (vitamin D)

**Social interactions**
Speak to people at work not about work. This change of topic is refreshing for the brain. 

**Visualize yourself being energetic and enthusiastic**
