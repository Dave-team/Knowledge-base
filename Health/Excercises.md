# Excercises

## Form checklists 
**Squat**
- Bar grip as tight as possible whilst still comfortable. Thumb grip on top on bar
- Heels shoulder width apart - toes pointing out at around 30 degrees
- Eyes at the floor a few meters in front of you
- Torso and shoulders tight, chest and elbows up
- Big breath - hold the breath
- The position to squat to: 
  - "Sit back, lean forward, shove your knees out, point your nipples at the floor"
  - Knees out and in line with toes 
  - Flat back at about a 45 degree angle
  - Butt at least paralel to the floor
- Moving upwards: 
  - Don't pause at the bottom
  - Move the butt straight up in the air. This means that the rest of the body is delayed in its movement

**Deadlift**
- Step 1: Stance: fairly narrow. Toes pointed slightly out. Bar is 1 inch from the shins
- Step 2: Take a grip by bending over at the waist - don't bend through the knees or lower the hips. Really be stiff legged. DO NOT move the bar. 
- Step 3: bend the knees and drop them forward where the shins touch the bar. Shove the knees out a little so they touch the elbows.
- Step 4: chest up. Do not lower the hips. This will feel odd which is shoud. Look at a point 10 m away so the neck has a natural position 
- Step 5: the pull. Take a big breath and hold it. Drag the bar up your legs. It stays in touch with the legs. End if with shoulders back and chest puffed up. Stand proud of your pull. 
- Backwards: shove your hips backwards, letting the bar slide down the thighs. Once the bar passes the knees, bend the knees for the final bit.
