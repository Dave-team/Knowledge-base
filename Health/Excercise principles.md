# Muscle building 

## Programs
- Starting Strenght
- Stronglifts
- Kettlebell routines - Pavel Tsatsouline

## Principles
- Lift consistently heavier, eat correctly and sleep well 
- How muscles grow: by lifting, you are causing tiny tears in the muscle fibres. The body then repairs these (with enough rest and nutrients), and thereby adapts the muscles to better handle the stimulus that caused the damage (also called hypertrophy).
- Muscles grow from overload: heavy weights, short intense sets of relatively low reps. 
- The repair of the body is what determines the growth: repair is done using food and rest 
- Keep a training journal. If you can’t measure it, you don’t know it 
- You need to consistently lift heavier than before. Either heavier weights or 1-2 more reps  
- Make sure to keep tracking against goals. Whether it’s increase in muscle mass, decrease in fat, increase in weight/flexibility/speed. Tracking will keep you motivated and focused on the goal 
- Don't forget to train wrist and neck muscles

## Workout principles 
- Establish the mind muscle connection, make sure to breath and go hard when doing the exercises and slow down on the way back
- The key to strength is really to tighten everything. Press, deadlift, squat: tighten glutes, midsection and have a strong grip. This makes everything easier. 
- Your mantra should be: “One more rep”
- Make sure to train with intensity and with focus: don’t leave anything in the tank and be mentally concentrated. 
- Rep timing: first part 2 seconds, 1 second pause, 2 second ending

## Workout routine 
### Warm-up 
With a good warm up you can increase strength whilst reducing the risk of injury. The goal of warming up is to infuse enough blood to the muscle and connective tissue so that they can handle the heavy sets.  How to warm up:
- First set of 12 reps with 50% of heavy set weight then 1-minute rest - light and easy 
- Second set: same weight as set 1, 10 reps but a little faster and then 1-minute rest
- Third set is 4 reps with 70% of heavy weight at moderate pace - still light and easy. 
- Fourth set: 1 rep with 90% of your heavy weight. Then rest 2-3 minutes 
- 5th, 6th and 7th set: heavy, muscle building sets. 
- As you then move to a new exercise within the same muscle group, don’t do a warm-up again, why bother as your muscle group is already fully warmed up. 
- When doing bodyweight excercises, do a warmup consisting of some cardio and mobilitiy excercises 

## Muscle building sets
- Use free weights as they stimulate the muscles much more – focus on compounds exercises that involve multiple muscle groups. The other type are isolated exercises. Heavy compound exercises will give you a solid foundation. Isolation exercises will sculpt your body once the basis is there 
- You need at least two (aim for three) proper workings sets – sets that actually push you to the max – per exercise
- Train 1-2 muscle groups per day. This is no 2 major muscle groups. So it’s either one big muscle group. 1 big one small or two small muscle groups. It’s not possible to train 2 big groups within 30-45 minutes (preferred workout time). Also, mentally you can’t put 100% in training 2 big muscle groups a day. 
- Sets of 4-6 reps for nearly all exercises. Abs and calves can do 10-12 reps. This means weight light enough for at least 4 reps buy heavy enough to prevent doing more than 6 reps. Generally between 80 and 85% of 1RM. When you can do 6 perfect reps, add weight so you can only do 4 on the next set. Heavy weights also increase growth hormone and testosterone production
- Do 6-9 working sets per muscle group. Do 9 for all muscle groups except biceps and triceps - they get 6. 
- Rest 2-3 minutes between sets as you’ll need enough recovery to perform again to the max in the next set. 
- Do similar movements only once during a workout: don’t do flat barbell and then flat dumbbell press. Instead, go all in on one exercise / movement 
- Try not to go to failure as it will merely cause exhaustion 
- Keep sessions to 45-60 minutes
- Train each muscle group once every 5-7 days. 
- Take a week off training every 8-10 weeks. 
- Also when cutting, lift heavy. This will preserve your muscles by continuing to overload the body.

## Exercises
- In general, you want to start with the most basic exercise (bench, squat, deadlift, military press, barbell curl). 
- For shoulders, have one exercise for each head. 
- For chest, legs, back, do 3 exercises each. For abs, do three exercises each. Calves is okay with 1. Biceps and also triceps get 2 exercises each 
- Kettlebells are a great addition to a workout for alteration
- Cross fit excercises such as Power clean, snatch, double under, box jumps, start rowing

## Cardio
Add cardio to your workout plan, even when bulking. 
- Do cardio 3-5 times per week (3 when bulking, 5 when cutting)
- Do HIIT cardio for 20-30 minutes per session. Long, low intensity cardio tend to negatively impact muscle growth. (2-3 minute warmup, 1 minute all in, 1 minute slow down, 1 minute all in, 2-3 minutes cool down). This for 20-30 minutes 
- Separate weights and cario sessions by several hours. Doing it during the same session tires you (pre workout), or uses up your most anabolic state (post workout)

## Fat loss
How to lose fat: make your body burn more energy that it gets from food. Cardio can help by burning calories and speeding op metabolic rate 
- Eat less that you expend = lose weight. Your body makes up for the deficit in calories by burning fat. Key is to ensure that you lose fat and not also muscle. When you eat less, your metabolic rate will slow down and then when you eat more again, you’ll quickly gain the fat back (yo-yo’ing)
- Eat small, frequent meals. Why? It increases metabolism (not 100% conclusion on this) but it does ensure that you can control your calorie intake better throughout the day. 
- Use cardio to help burn fat. 

## Become better at bodyweight excercises
- Increase repetitions / length of sets 
- Do as many sets as you can and increase this volume over time. Start with 10-10-10 then 11-10-10 etc. 
- Alternatively, do a high number of sets with low repetitions – e.g. 20 sets of 2 pull-ups 
You won’t be able to do all exercises from the start – do progression. Start off with easy exercises up to a number of reps with perfect form. Then you move on until you reach the end goal exercise you want to master 
- When stuck, do alternative exercise or do other progression exercises before coming back
