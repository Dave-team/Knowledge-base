# Sleep
During sleep our heart rate drops, our body temperature falls and we experience complex changes in brain activity.
- When we first fall asleep we enter non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM is divided into three stages: – NREM1 – NREM2 and – NREM3, each stage becoming progressively ‘deeper’.
- Stages 1 and 2 are light stages of sleep from which we can be easily roused.
- Stage 3 is a deeper stage of sleep from which we’re more difficult to rouse, and some may feel disorientated if woken from this stage of sleep.
- Generally, after going through the NREM stages, we enter stage 4 which is known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which the EEG shows as being similar to wakefulness or drowsiness. It is during the REM stage of sleep that we dream.
- Each cycle lasts around 1½ hours and we need to experience all four stages in order to wake up rested.
- A good night’s sleep consists of five or six cycles, whereas disturbed sleep consists of far fewer.
