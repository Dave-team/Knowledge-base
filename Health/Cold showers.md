# Cold showers
- Step 1: Step under the warm shower and wash yourself
- Step 2: Turn the water to cold, set your intention and enter the cold shower. Start with e.g. 30 seconds and increase this duration over time
- Step 3: Remain relaxed, control your breathing and do your best not to tense up
- Step 4: Smile, enjoy and never force

Turn the shower on full-blast, and then I walk right in. I don’t give myself any time to hesitate. As soon as I hear the voice in my head telling me how cold it’s going to be, I know I have to walk in. I learned a very important lesson from this: most of our suffering comes from avoidance. Most of the suffering from a cold shower is the tip-toeing your way in. Once you’re in, you’re in. It’s not suffering. It’s just cold. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold. Acknowledge your body saying it’s cold. Look at it. Deal with it. Accept it, but don’t mentally suffer over it. Taking a cold shower for two minutes isn’t going to kill you.
