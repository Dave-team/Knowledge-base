# Cold showers
- Step 1: Step under the warm shower and wash yourself
- Step 2: Turn the water to cold, set your intention and enter the cold shower. Start with e.g. 30 seconds and increase this duration over time
- Step 3: Remain relaxed, control your breathing and do your best not to tense up
- Step 4: Smile, enjoy and never force

Or: just walk in a cold shower. Once you're in, you're in.
