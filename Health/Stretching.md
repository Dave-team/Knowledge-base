# Stretching

## Principles
- Be consistent - stretch e.g. 10 minutes every single day in the morning 
- Stretch intensely after every workout
- Do more stretching where you are the weakest 
- Pick a few stretches and become good at them rather than doing many stretches average

## Stretching tips
- Be relaxed - take deep breaths from the belly. 
- Get into the max stretch position of an exercise. Hold for 10 seconds before taking a deep breath in. Hold breath for a couple of seconds and then release all in one go, relaxing your entire body. Repeat 3-5 times 
- Make a lengthened muscle stronger. Be in a stretch position. Then contract the muscle being stretched. Hold for 5-10 seconds before relaxing and then increase the stretch. Repeat 2-3 times whilst slowly increasing your stretch. 
- The stretches you hold are supposed to last 60 seconds, ideally in one sit. You can break it down if need be. A stretch shouldn’t be less than 20 seconds. If you can’t hold 20 seconds, lessen the intensity. 
- With all exercises, make sure there is a full range of motion. Also, don’t try to cheat e.g. using momentum or in other way executing the form less than perfect. 

## Stretching excercises
### Shoulders  
- Shoulder roll – roll your shoulders one way and then the other way but very relaxed
- Knees and hands are on the floor and the hips are lifted high up in the air. Hold for 15-20 seconds before releasing (basically a high baby pose)
- Shoulder extension – sit on the floor, place your hands behind your back and squeeze in the shoulder blades

### Chest
- One arm straight and hook into the other arm 
- Chest stretch - arms back rested against something whilst you lean your body forwards 

### Upper back
- Upper back stretch: straight legs, bend through the hips and place hands on something (you're body is exactly 90 degress with arms straight in front)
- Rear hand clasp – touch your hands, the right arm coming from the top, and the left arm coming from the bottom. Reach as far as you can and you can use a towel or similar to help reaching
- Standing position - left arm to left upper corner and right arm to right lower corner 

### Lower back
- Upward dog / cobra stretch - lie on the floor and curl the spine and look up to the ceiling 

### Neck
- Neck roll – roll your neck one way and then other way but very relaxed
- Neck excercise from 10 minute yoga 

### Forearms and wrist
- Forearms / wrist stretch - sit on hands and knees whilst pointing fingers forwards. Also, sit in the same position but point your fingers backwards 

### Arms
- Arms stretch - one hand overhead behind the neck and then the other arm on top if the elbow to further stretch down 

### Core 
- Standing side stretch. Feet shoulder width apart - arms overhead (as if holding a stick) and lean to the sides whilst holding the stick to stretch the oblique (again for 15 seconds)

### Full body 
- Downward dog – the feet and hand are placed on the floor and then you raise your butt up high, keeping your back and neck in the same line 
- Cat and cow stretch: on hands and knees. Round the back and look down (cat stretech) than arch the lower back and look upwards (cow) 
- Lying twist – lie on your back with the arms stretched out either side (as if in a cross). Then, place your legs 90 degrees in a square on the floor (to either side), whilst keeping your upper body as low to the floor as possible  

### Hips
- Hip flexor stretch - go into lunge position - then put the back leg on floor and feel the stretch in your rear leg. Place the front leg quite to the front to increase the stretch and lift your chest
- Pigeon stretch
- Holding the deep squat position

### Hamstrings
- Good morning with one leg in front of the other 
- Standing pike: touch your toes 
- Hamstring stretch - sit down and stretch one leg out in front of you, toe pointing towards the ceiling. Tuck other foot inside your leg and reach forward with your arm and touch your toe. Keep back straight and fold from the hips. 
- Boxing stretch – lie on the floor and have one leg up in the air. Stretch it – possibly also using an elastic for more flexible stretching 

### Groin stretches
- Lie on floor and pull knees to chest
- Groin stretch - sit down with the soles of feet together. Pull them in as close to the bum as possible. Get your knees as close to the floor as possible. Can push down on thighs to help and hold for 15 seconds 
- Cossack squat – stand with your feet quite wide apart. Then squat into one leg whilst keeping the other leg straight to the sides – go as deep as you can 
  
### Glutes
- Glute stretch - like in boxing with one foot over the other knee and then holding the shin

### Quads
- Quad stretch - lie on your belly., take a foot and pull heel to ass. Knees need to be close together and hips pushed forward 

### Calves
- Calf stretch: lean forwards with hands resting against a wall, foots flat on the ground and then stretching out the calves muscle, at least 30 seconds a piece (by lifting heels off ground)
- Heal and toe walking / wobbling - walk on heels first, then on toes 

## Touching toes program 
When doing the toe touch, make sure to hip hinge - bend from the waist, keep your back completely straight and have your head in line in with back. When training, make sure to actually do touch your toes - even if this means bending in the knees ever so slightly. 

Best progression technique: stand with the toes on something slightly elevated. Put something between your legs that you can squeeze. Then, for e.g. 12 times reach down and actually touch your toes: reach tall with hands up towards the ceiling. Squeeze whatever is between your thighs. Keep squeezing as you bend down by hinging the hips - we want 0 lower back bending. Bend as much as you need to simply actually touch the toes. Then, after e.g. 5 times, switch sides and then have the heels elevated and do the same thing again. Reach tall, squeeze get down there

After doing that, take away the elevation and the squeeze thing. Place your finger under your toes - go low with the butt and from there raise the butt to as high as you can go. Don’t think about reaching your toes as that will cause your body to bend at places it shouldn’t be bending (lower back).
