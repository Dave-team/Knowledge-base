# Stretching

## Principles
1.	Be relaxed. Get into the max stretch position of an exercise. Hold for 10 seconds before taking a deep breath in. Hold breath for a couple of seconds and then release all in one go, relaxing your entire body. Repeat 3-5 times 
2.	Make a lengthened muscle stronger. Be in a stretch position. Then contract the muscle being stretched. Hold for 5-10 seconds before relaxing and then increase the stretch. Repeat 2-3 times whilst slowly increasing your stretch. 
3.	Be consistent - stretch e.g. 10 minutes every single day
4.	Stretch intensely after every workout (or just warm up before stretching) – it is like a separate workout and you will get sore 
5.	The stretches you hold are supposed to last 60 seconds, ideally in one sit. You can break it down if need be. A stretch shouldn’t be less than 20 seconds. If you can’t hold 20 seconds, lessen the intensity. The stretches should be after every single workout. 
6.	Do more stretching where you are the weakest 
7.	Breathing should be relaxed deep into the belly. 
8.	With all exercises, make sure there is a full range of motion. Also, don’t try to cheat e.g. using momentum or in other way executing the form less than perfect. 
9.	With stretching, only pick a very few exercises to start with, and stick to them. Do a few stretches really well rather than doing many stretches very average. 
10.	Again, choose just ONE stretch that works for you and STICK WITH IT. Hold it for 3-4 sets of 30-60seconds (5-10 breaths). Do not stretch in a “circuit-style” where you jump from stretch to stretch without holding it enough. Hold for a solid 30-60secs and use a timer, cause 10-20secs might feel like 60secs when it’s painful but the timer never lies. So basically just make sure you hit the recommended time for the stretch.
