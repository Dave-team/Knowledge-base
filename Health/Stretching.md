# Stretching

## Principles
- Be consistent - stretch e.g. 10 minutes every single day in the morning 
- Stretch intensely after every workout
- Do more stretching where you are the weakest 
- Pick a few stretches and become good at them rather than doing many stretches average



## Stretching tips
- Be relaxed - take deep breaths from the belly. 
- Get into the max stretch position of an exercise. Hold for 10 seconds before taking a deep breath in. Hold breath for a couple of seconds and then release all in one go, relaxing your entire body. Repeat 3-5 times 
- Make a lengthened muscle stronger. Be in a stretch position. Then contract the muscle being stretched. Hold for 5-10 seconds before relaxing and then increase the stretch. Repeat 2-3 times whilst slowly increasing your stretch. 
- The stretches you hold are supposed to last 60 seconds, ideally in one sit. You can break it down if need be. A stretch shouldn’t be less than 20 seconds. If you can’t hold 20 seconds, lessen the intensity. 
- With all exercises, make sure there is a full range of motion. Also, don’t try to cheat e.g. using momentum or in other way executing the form less than perfect.
