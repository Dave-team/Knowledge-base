### Patch testing
Goal: understand if I'm allergic or if irritation occurs from using a new skincare product. Often recommended to test for at least 1 week.  
- Allergy test - Test on inner arm for 24 hours.
- Irritation test - Test on one jawline/cheek. This makes sure it doesn't spread across face and serves as a basis for comparison as it's easy to see if something is changing. 
- Face test: test the product for a month or so to see if it actually improves the skin

### Other 
- Apply occasional face mask 
- Drink lots of water in the morning 
- Stop touching the face

## Brushing teeth
- Do not brush horizontally, especially not over the gum
- Floss on a daily basis (ideally both rope and brush) prior to brushing teeth
- Brush more gently
- Buy sensitive toothpaste 

## Eyecare
- Figure 8 - make an octagon with your eyes covering all wide corners. Do this for 8 breaths 
- Warm your hands by rubbing and then putting hands on eyes
