### Patch testing
Goal: understand if I'm allergic or if irritation occurs from using a new skincare product. Often recommended to test for at least 1 week.  
- Allergy test - Test on inner arm for 24 hours.
- Irritation test - Test on one jawline/cheek. This makes sure it doesn't spread across face and serves as a basis for comparison as it's easy to see if something is changing. 
- Face test: test the product for a month or so to see if it actually improves the skin

### Other 
- Apply occasional face mask 
- Drink lots of water in the morning 
- Stop touching the face

**Types of fragrance**
The different types of fragrances differ by their concentration, which can indicate longevity (in practice this isn't always true)
- Parfum (20-30%)
- Eau de parfum (15-20%)
- Eau de Toilette (5-15%)
- Eau de Cologne (3-8%)
- Aftershave (<3%)


**How to review**
As with everything, take a break. Be free from distractions and be intentional to the fragrance. And take notes somewhere. 
- Consider what you smell
  - Does it give you certain images? 
  - Does it resemble something? 
  - Does it fit into a certain mood? Does it make you feel a certain way? Does it bring up any memories? 
  - Can you even analyse parts of the fragrance and find certain notes? No need to overthink this - e.g. do the same as describing foods - salty, sweet, bitter, etc. 
  - And finally: like it or not? 

Become better at smelling: 
- Intentionally smell everything in life: flowers, food, drinks, candles, essential oils. 
- Smell a fragrance and refer to the reviews. Can you recognize some smells? 
- Google: what does X (insert any note here) smell like? 

- Overall rating 
- General smell
- Silage: Used to describe the way a fragrance leaves a trail behind the wearer.
- Projection: A fragrance’s projection is quite simply how it radiates from the wearer over time
- Longevity: A fragrance’s longevity is how long it lasts over the day. In other words, this evaluates its lifespan and how well it lingers on the wearer’s skin.
- Versatility: i.e. Occasion/season 
- Value

**Fragrance notes**
Top (or opening): first notes you smell when trying a fragrance. Often fresh and light. Fade in 15 minutes. these are the opening notes.
Middle (or heart): appear once top notes evaporate. Often pleasant and well rounded.
Base (or bottom): Final notes appearing - these are the notes that are remembered the most. The base notes lay the foundation for the fragrance and will determine how long the fragrance lasts on your skin. Lasting 5-10 hours

**How to buy fragrance**
Wear it on the skin as different body oils mix differently with different skins. It’s not the same as paper (only smelling top notes) and definitely not the same as the smell from the bottle. 
Be careful not to buy too much: 
- Use up a full sample
- Miss it after completing the sample
- Buy a 10 ml version - often quite economical 
- After 10 ml still like it - buy a bottle; especially if current collection is not the same. 

**How to store fragrance**
Dark, dry and cool. Avoid heat fluctuations like in the bathroom and sunlight. Ideally in original boxes in a dark and cool cupboard. 

**How to test fragrances**
Let your samples rest for a week as the transit might have influenced the smell. 
Initial test is on the wrist/elbow. Smell frequently to understand how it develops and longevity.  
Test a perfume over more than one wear. So don't judge too quickly. Give it a few days and then try again. 

I spray few sprays of my new colognes to drapes of my living room. Then leave the room. After sometime I pass by the drape and try to feel what other people smell when I spray the perfume in my cloths. 


**Applying fragnance**
General rule: apply where the body produces the most heat. How much and where to spray is depending on occassion and intensity of the fragrance. 
- Spray wrist - lightly press them together- don't rub as that will cause the heat to waste
- Dab the wrists against the neck under the chin or jaw
- Chest if needed: only when it's suitable and not overwhelming
- 1 or 2 sprays 20 cm from skin
- Not on clothing
- Weak fragrances can be reapplied during the day using e.g. travel atomiser.
