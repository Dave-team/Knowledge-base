# Glossary
TISSUE: Tissue is body material in animals and plants that’s made up of large numbers of cells that are similar in form and function.

MUSCLE: Muscles are masses of tissue in the body, often attached to bones that can tighten and relax to produce movement.

CALORIE: A calorie is a measurement unit of the amount of energy that can be produced by food. One calorie is enough energy to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. Thus, when you’re referring to the calories contained in food, you’re referring to the potential energy stored in the food.

PROTEIN: Proteins are naturally occurring compounds that are used for growth and repair in the body and to build cells and tissues. Muscle tissue contains lots of protein. Protein keeps you strong and makes your bones last. It is an essential nutrient for life.

AMINO ACID: Amino acids are very small units of material that protein is built out of.

CARBOHYDRATE: Carbohydrates are chemical elements composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Carbohydrates are important nutrients for energy and for building cells in the body. The word carbohydrate is formed by carbo- which means carbon, and –hydrate which means water. It is an essential nutrient for life.

ENZYME: An enzyme is a substance produced by organisms that helps cause specific chemical reactions.

METABOLISM: Metabolism is the term for the series of processes by which molecules from food are broken down to release energy, which is then used to fuel the cells in the body and to create more complex molecules used for building new cells. Metabolism is necessary for life and is how the body creates and maintains the cells that make it up.
Note: When the body becomes hungry, one’s metabolism slows down and less energy is released. The longer someone waits between meals, the slower their metabolism goes.

ANABOLISM: Anabolism is a metabolic process in which energy is used to make more complex substances (such as tissue) from simpler ones.

CATABOLISM: Catabolism is the production of energy through the conversion of complex molecules (such as muscle or fat) into simpler ones.

GLUCOSE: Glucose is a very simple sugar that is an important energy source in living things. Most carbohydrates are broken down in the body into glucose, which is the main source of fuel for all cells.

GLYCOGEN: Glycogen is a substance found in bodily tissues that acts as a store of carbohydrates.

SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATE: A simple carbohydrate is a very simple form of sugar that is usually sweet tasting and is broken down into glucose very quickly.

COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATE: A complex carbohydrate is a carbohydrate that is made up of many molecules of “simple carbohydrates” linked together. Because of this, it takes the body longer to break it down into glucose.

HORMONE: A hormone is a chemical made in the body that gets transported by the blood or other bodily fluids to cells and organs to cause some action or to have a specific effect.

INSULIN: Insulin is a hormone that consists of protein and is made in the organ known as the pancreas. When someone eats food, the carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream to be delivered to the body’s cells. When this happens, the body detects the change in blood sugar and releases insulin, which causes muscles, organs, and fat tissue to take up the glucose and either use it or store it as energy. It also causes cells to take up amino acids and build muscles.

Note: When insulin is released, the body does not use its stored fat to get energy; it only gets energy from the food that is being digested. When a person eats foods containing lots of simple carbohydrates, high amounts of insulin are released into the blood. The carbohydrates get broken down and are either used or stored as fat and glycogen very quickly, giving a boost in energy. Because all of the glucose gets broken down and stored quickly, however, the energy boost runs out very fast, and the person experiences the “crash” that comes after a sugar high.
If this is repeated on a regular basis, the insulin keeps being produced and released into the bloodstream in high amounts, bringing too much glucose to the tissues in the body. These tissues will eventually start resisting this and will refuse to accept the insulin. The extra sugar in the blood that cannot be utilized now can cause damage to the blood circulation system and ends up being stored as fat. Since the insulin is no longer helping the cells absorb glucose properly, the body is left feeling hungry, causing the person to eat even more. As this continues over a long period of time, the pancreas can get exhausted and stop producing enough insulin, causing the cells to become starved for glucose and die. (see also diabetes)

GLYCEMIC INDEX: The glycemic index (or GI) is a scale that measures the effect of different carbohydrates on one’s blood sugar level. Carbohydrates that break down slowly and release glucose into the blood slowly are low on the glycemic index. Carbohydrates that break down quickly will release glucose into the blood quickly, causing insulin levels to suddenly spike; these are high on the glycemic index. Below 55 on the GI is considered low, and above 70 is considered high. Pure glucose is 100 on the GI.

FIBER: Fiber is a substance found in some grains, fruit, and vegetables that cannot be digested. Fiber serves to soak up extra water and push other food through the digestive system. It helps push useless food waste out of the body, preventing it from sitting in the system and clogging it. Fiber is considered to play a role in the prevention of many diseases of the digestive tract.

FATTY ACIDS: Fatty acids are the molecules that make up fat cells. Some fatty acids are needed for building parts of cells and tissues in the body. Fatty acids contain twice as many calories as carbohydrates and proteins and are mainly used to store energy in fat tissue.

VITAMIN: A vitamin is a naturally occurring compound that is needed in small amounts by the body but cannot be produced in the body, and therefore, it needs to be absorbed from an outside source. Not getting enough vitamins in your diet leads to many undesirable conditions and possibly fatal diseases.

MINERAL: A mineral is a compound that is found in non-living matter. They are not naturally created inside of living organisms, but they are required by the body to maintain proper function.

PROCESSED: To process food means to use chemicals or a machine to change or preserve the food.
Note: The action of processing foods done by food manufacturers often kills many of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that the body needs, and it typically adds chemicals into the food.

DEHYDRATION: The human body is made of 75% water. Water is lost by sweating, urination, and breathing, and this water needs to be replaced every day. When not enough water has been replaced for the body to properly function, it is called dehydration. This gives you a headache, makes you tired and weak, and if not fixed, can be fatal since all vital organs need water to exist and function.

NERVE: A nerve is a bundle of fibres in the body that carries electrical messages between the brain, spinal cord, organs, and muscles. These messages give sensations and cause muscles and organs to operate. Nerves are the communication system of the body.
Example: The orders from the brain to make the fingers move were transmitted through the nerves.

SALT: Salt is a mineral that is used a lot in cooking for seasoning food. It has its own taste that is one of the basic tastes of the human diet. Salt is a very important electrolyte and mineral that is necessary for many bodily functions.

CHOLESTEROL: Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance found among some fats that moves through your bloodstream and into your body’s cells. Your body makes some cholesterol, and the rest comes from animal products consumed, such as meat, fish, eggs, butter, cheese, and whole milk. Cholesterol is not found in foods made from plants.
Note: One kind of cholesterol, known as “good cholesterol,” is necessary for survival and is used in building the cells in the body and for other important functions. “Bad cholesterol” can get stuck in your bloodstream and block the flow of blood, causing a heart-attack if you have too much of it in the bloodstream.

SATURATED FAT: Saturated fat is a kind a fat found in some foods that tends to increase the amount of bad cholesterol in the blood.

UNSATURATED FAT: Unsaturated fat is a kind of fat found in food that does not raise levels of bad cholesterol, and it actually seems to lower the levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is also necessary for building cells and other body functions. Though it does have these healthy qualities, it is still a fat and has high calories, so if eaten in a large amounts, it will still make a person gain fat tissue.

TRANS FAT: Trans fat is fat that has been altered by a man-made process used to make the fat re-usable for frying things and to make foods last longer on the shelf. Trans fats have been shown to raise the level of bad cholesterol and lower the level of good cholesterol as well as lead to heart disease and some other severe diseases.
Example: Trans fats can but found in many foods, especially in fried foods like French fries and donuts as well as store-bought pastries, pizza dough, cookies, and crackers.
