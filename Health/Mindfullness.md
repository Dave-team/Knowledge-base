# Mindfullness
“Mindfulness” is a practice of learning to stay in the present moment and observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Part of mindfulness is also accepting your experiences without making judgments about them. Part of being mindful is to notice your mental drift without judging it.
- “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself”
- The present is all we have: There is actually nothing but this moment. No one has ever gone back in time, and no one has ever been able to successfully predict the future in any way that matters.
- We crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.
- We’re in a constant race for the next thing. When we try to do exactly nothing, we can’t do it, because there’s anxiety always trying to make you get up and go, get up and go, get up and go. This anxiety is making you unhappy. The anxiety is just a series of running thoughts. 
- How to combat these thoughts
  - Don’t try and fight it, just notice them and be aware that you’re out of control. This awareness alone can calm you down. 
  - Go in debugging mode. Ask yourself: “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” Because as long as I have my thoughts, I can’t have my peace. “Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself? Who cares? I’m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero, and I won’t remember anything, so this is pointless.” “Do I really need to solve this problem right now?” Ninety-five percent of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don’t need to tackle in that exact moment. If the brain is like a muscle, I’ll be better off resting it, being at peace
- Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.

## Principles
- Make it a habit – e.g. first thing in the morning and have a determined place where you meditate
- One thing to realize here is that you are not in control of your thinking. You are simply an observer to whatever happens and whatever your mind produces
- Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.
- There are different types of meditation: Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Praying is gratitude meditation. Showering is accidental meditation. Sitting quietly is direct meditation.

## Preparation
- Set your intention for the session and focus on what's coming. Treat it as a workout and a learning session. Don’t expect anything and just see what happens

## Why meditate
- To increase awareness and control thought by establishing a deep connection with my mind 
- To be more present / in the moment day to day, especially during conversions
- To increase concentration and focus for longer
- To be more effective in my thoughts about work and to realize in better fashion what the right thing to do is
- The first thing to realize is you can observe your mental state. Meditation doesn’t mean you’re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. 

## Types of meditation
**Nonjudgmental Awareness**. As you’re going about your daily business, you practice learning to accept the moment you’re in without making judgments. You don’t judge anything. You just accept everything. 

**Transcendental meditation**: using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. 

### Naval meditation 
- Each morning, give you yourself a break from life for one hour
- Sit somewhere comfortably and shut your eyes for one hour 
- Thoughts will come. Don’t resist them and don’t work with them. Just observe them - whatever happens, happens. Don't put effort into it, don't put effort against it - just surrended in the moment. Meditation is not going through thoughts but rather letting thoughts go through you.
- What will happen is that all of your life will eventually fly you by and you will have given most things a place in your mind. If you do 60 days 60 minutes meditation, eventually you should reach inbox 0 in your mind. This is when you no longer have any ‘issues’ to deal with in your mind. 

### Standard meditation
**Process**
- Sit on floor/chair/cushion with muscles relaxed and back straight 
- Close my eyes
- Perform a few deep and slow breaths with the purpose of losing the body and relax the muscles
- Notice the sensations throughout the body – warmth, cold, discomfort, etc. Be aware but don’t dwell on them 
- Breath normally, possibly with a short pause between the in and out breath. Focus here on bodily sensations related to the breath – around the nose, face, mouth, chest, abdomen. Take your time to get used to these feelings.  
- Start paying attention to the meditation object – the sensation of the breath. Focus on only the area where the sensations are the clearest – e.g. around the nostrils. Do no longer follow the rhythm of the breath. While you pay attention to the object, your peripheral awareness remains relaxed and open to anything that arises. 

**Distractions**
- Be aware of the distraction
    - What is it?
    - How strong is it?
    - How long does it last?
- Realize that distractions are fine - don't force anything. Notice them, then slowly return to the breath. Let it come, let it be, let it go 
- If distracted, it’s always important to go back to normal breathing first before focusing on the meditation object to get back in the flow 

**Mind wandering solutions **
- Count the breaths, e.g. one at a time, or 1-10 on each in and exhale in rapid succession. Or else 1-1-1-1 in, then 2-2-2-2 ex, and so further. The goal is to keep track of the count and e.g. reach 10. When the mind wanders of, start again at 0. The mind will wander, just don’t lose complete track of the breath or the counting. Once you’ve reached 10 without issues, stop counting and just focus on the breath. 
- Take some more deep breaths
- Use "in-out" instead of counting the breaths

## 10 stages to meditation
1. Spend time daily to actively and wholeheartedly meditate 
2. Keeping the attention on the breath. This mainly consist of getting back to the breath when the mind starts wandering. The opposite is forgetting to get back to the breath, which is when meditation just doesn’t really work. The aim is to reduce the amount of time you spend mind wandering and focus the time spend on the meditation object
3.  Extending the period of attention and reduce the forgetting of getting back to the breath. Here, you start focusing on introspective attention as well – which is essentially become really aware of what is happening in your mind 

By the end of the 3rd stage, you’ve reached the first Milestone and are no longer a beginner. Now you can continuous attention to the meditation object without wind wandering or forgetting

4. Continuous attention and overcoming distraction and dullness – the breath is still main focus point and just focussing on the breath doesn’t lead to dullness
5. Get rid of subtle dullness essentially by doing even more introspective mindfulness work 
6. Single pointed attention to the meditation object

Second milestone reached: you can now focus on the breath without being distracted by the background and you aware of your state of mind in every moment 

7. Sustained and exclusive attention to any object but still havening to put in the effort 

Milestone 3: effortless stability of attention 

8. The only limitation is in how far you can physically stay in the same position 
9. No longer is your physical position a showstopper
10. When the mind is pretty much in meditative state even when not meditating 

Milestone 4: mastery of meditation 

## Other mindfullness techniques
- Focus on something and describe it in as much detail as possible. How it feels, looks, tastes, sounds. From all different angles in different contexts. 
- Step outside yourself and observe your mental process - am I being hijacked by anything? 

## Meditation findings 
- It's hard to focus when I already know I want to be doing things. I'm a morning person and just want to get started
