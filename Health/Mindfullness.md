# Mindfullness

## Definition 
“Mindfulness” is a practice of learning to stay in the present moment and observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Accepting our experiences and thoughts without making judgments about them. 

Being mindful is to be aware of our experience, moment-to-moment, in a quite particular way, with curiosity, with kindness and with care and without judgement. 

As you watch your thoughts, you realize how many of them are fear based. The moment you recognize a fear, without even trying it goes away. After a while, your mind quiets. When your mind quiets, you stop taking everything around you for granted. You start to notice the details. You think, “Wow, I live in such a beautiful place. It’s so great that I have clothes, and I can go to Starbucks and get a coffee anytime. Look at these people—each one has a perfectly valid and complete life going on in their own heads.” It pops us out of the story we’re constantly telling ourselves. If you stop talking to yourself for even ten minutes, if you stop obsessing over your own story, you’ll realize we are really far up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and life is pretty good. 

## Why it matters
- “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself”
- “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.”
- You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf.
- Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.
- We’re in a constant race for the next thing. When we try to do exactly nothing, we can’t do it, because there’s anxiety always trying to make you get up and go, get up and go, get up and go. This anxiety is making you unhappy. The anxiety is just a series of running thoughts. 
- The present is all we have: There is actually nothing but this moment. No one has ever gone back in time, and no one has ever been able to successfully predict the future in any way that matters.
- We crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.

## Benefits of mindfullness 
- To increase awareness and control thought by establishing a deep connection with my mind 
- When we pay attention to how we are thinking and feeling right now, we become better at spotting the build up of uncomfortable emotions and thoughts – so that we can deal with them more effectively, instead of just reacting in ways that might not be good for us. 
- We learn that thoughts are just thoughts. They are not facts and we can choose whether to give them power over our minds and hearts. 
- By practicing mindfullness in good times we're better able to control situations when the going gets tough. 
- To be more present / in the moment day to day, especially during conversions
- To increase concentration and focus for longer
- To be more effective in my thoughts about work and to realize in better fashion what the right thing to do is
- The first thing to realize is you can observe your mental state. Meditation doesn’t mean you’re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. 
- Let's you refocus on what matters. Taking a breather before going on autopilot makes me consider what I actually want to do next. And if I then do something first that breaks the autopilot old habits, I may find that I really enjoy it. Being aware that it’s your old routines appealing. Be aware that it’s your autopilot. Recognise that you want to do the thing but hold off doing it until it comes natural
- Able to be fully aware in the moment and do exactly what needs to be done on that thing I'm working on. 

**How mindfulness changes the brain**
- Enlarges the prefrontal cortex. This area of the brain is associates with higher order brain functions such as awareness, concentration and decision-making
- Shrinks the amygdala. The amygdala is a key brain structure known as the emotional or fear center of the brain. Smaller amygdalae found in more mindful people are associated with greater emotional control

## Types of mindfullness practices
- Being fully engaged in activity - walking outside, brushing teeth, writing, taking a shower, eating, drinking tea. Do these things with present moment awareness, interest and care. 
- Regularly taking a pause from what we're doing and tune into our breathing, our senses, our moods how our bodies feel.
- Purposefully engaging in activity. Focus on something and describe it in as much detail as possible. How it feels, looks, tastes, sounds. From all different angles in different contexts. And don't judge it - when listening to raindrops, focus on how the sounds are distinguishable rather than directly qualifying them as raindrops.
- Relax, look around you and just sit. Be amazed at how beautiful things are. How far we’ve come in our lives and in the universe and be grateful. 
- Pause appreciate and reflect on what we have and have done. Appreciate beauty and immerse on the moment whatever you do
- Part of it is to fully embrace possible boredom 
- Meditation. Meditation is a way of cultivating mindfulness. 

## Outside mindfullness
- When in nature, what can help being mindful is to understand the trees, the appearance and sounds of birds. 
- Count the colours you’re seeing - spot the shades of green 
- Notice whether people wear jeans etc. 

## Combat thoughts to be more mindful 
- Don’t try and fight it, just notice them and be aware that you’re out of control. This awareness alone can calm you down. 
- When thoughts arise, let them flow by. Do not engage with them. I am not my thoughts - they are merely things that flow by 
- Go in debugging mode. Ask yourself: “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” Because as long as I have my thoughts, I can’t have my peace. “Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself? Who cares? I’m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero, and I won’t remember anything, so this is pointless.” “Do I really need to solve this problem right now?” Ninety-five percent of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don’t need to tackle in that exact moment. If the brain is like a muscle, I’ll be better off resting it, being at peace
- I’m actually going back to my awareness level of OS, which is always calm, always peaceful, and generally happy and content. I’m trying to stay in awareness mode and not activate the monkey mind, which is always worried, frightened, and anxious. It serves incredible purpose, but I try not to activate the monkey mind until I need it. When I need it, I want to just focus on that. If I run it 24/7, I waste energy and the monkey mind becomes me. I am more than my monkey mind.

## Our minds 
**Thinking Mind / Doing Mind**
- Thoughts will always continue to pop up. We can't control the Thinking Mind. The trick is to not fuse and identify with the those as they come up. Instead of saying, “I am nervous,” say, “I feel nervousness." Disidentify and then take possession of strong thoughts. Disidentifying from these emotions and thoughts in this way does two things:
  - implies that they’re temporary states, and not permanent conditions;
  - forces you to take responsibility for them. They’re nobody’s fault, they just are.
- We can also thank our negative emotions. It will diminish the power of the thoughts and emotions and impels to take action despite them. “Thank you, Thinking Mind, for feeling nervous before my date tonight. It will keep me on my toes!”
- When people come to me ask how to “stop feeling angry,” or “stop getting nervous,” this is their problem: As soon as you try to eliminate a thought or emotion, you make it stronger. As the Buddhist saying goes: “What you resist will persist.” Negative emotions are like quicksand, the more you struggle to get out of them, the further into them you sink.
-  I feel the same fear and worry anyone else does, I just don’t identify with it. I accept it and move on despite it.
I don’t let my Thinking Mind control me. I defuse from my emotions. When I feel fear, I consciously choose to act despite it. When I feel worry, I consciously choose to act despite it.
- Our thinking mind tries to solve problems all the time. A lot of problems however can't be solved or they don't need to be solved now. When you are caught in a trap of solving problems, return to awareness and just 'being'. We cannot solve feelings and we cannot solve the future and we cannot solve the past. 

**Being Mind**
- This part of the brain is aware, relaxed and in the present moment. It is developed through mindfulness excercise 
- This mode responds to impulses from the Thinking Mind


## Mindfullness principles
- Make it a habit – e.g. first thing in the morning and have a determined place where you meditate
- Reflect not on future when there are more immediate things to reflect on
- One thing to realize here is that you are not in control of your thinking. You are simply an observer to whatever happens and whatever your mind produces
- Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.
- The practice of mindfulness is to be aware and then just start again. There is no goal and we will always be distracted by thoughts

## Meditation

### Preparation
- Set your intention for the session and focus on what's coming. Treat it as a workout and a learning session. Don’t expect anything and just see what happens

### Types of meditation
**Nonjudgmental Awareness**. As you’re going about your daily business, you practice learning to accept the moment you’re in without making judgments. You don’t judge anything. You just accept everything. 

**Transcendental meditation**: using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. 

**Naval meditation**
- Each morning, give you yourself a break from life for one hour. Close your eyes and say, “I’m just going to give myself a break for an hour. This is my hour off from life. This is the hour I’m not going to do anything. Why can you not do anything for an hour? What’s so hard about giving yourself an hour-long break? 
- Sit somewhere comfortably and shut your eyes for one hour 
- Thoughts will come. Don’t resist them and don’t work with them. Just observe them - whatever happens, happens. Don't put effort into it, don't put effort against it - just surrended in the moment. Meditation is not going through thoughts but rather letting thoughts go through you.
- They will come out one by one, and you will be forced to deal with them. Resolving them doesn’t take any work—you just observe them.
- What will happen is that all of your life will eventually fly you by and you will have given most things a place in your mind. If you do 60 days 60 minutes meditation, eventually you should reach inbox 0 in your mind. This is when you no longer have any ‘issues’ to deal with in your mind. It’s a state of joy and bliss and peace. Once you have it, you don’t want to give it up. If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning just by sitting and closing your eyes, that is worth its weight in gold. It will change your life. After about sixty days, you will be tired of listening to your own mind. You will have resolved a lot of issues, or you have heard them enough to see through those fears and issues.

#### Standard meditation
**Process**
- Sit on floor/chair/cushion with muscles relaxed and back straight 
- Close my eyes
- Perform a few deep and slow breaths with the purpose of losing the body and relax the muscles
- Notice the sensations throughout the body – warmth, cold, discomfort, etc. Be aware but don’t dwell on them 
- Breath normally, possibly with a short pause between the in and out breath. Focus here on bodily sensations related to the breath – around the nose, face, mouth, chest, abdomen. Take your time to get used to these feelings.  
- Start paying attention to the meditation object – the sensation of the breath. Focus on only the area where the sensations are the clearest – e.g. around the nostrils. Do no longer follow the rhythm of the breath. While you pay attention to the object, your peripheral awareness remains relaxed and open to anything that arises. 

**Distractions**
- Be aware of the distraction
    - What is it?
    - How strong is it?
    - How long does it last?
- Realize that distractions are fine - don't force anything. Notice them, then slowly return to the breath. Let it come, let it be, let it go 
- If distracted, it’s always important to go back to normal breathing first before focusing on the meditation object to get back in the flow 

**Mind wandering solutions**
- Count the breaths, e.g. one at a time, or 1-10 on each in and exhale in rapid succession. Or else 1-1-1-1 in, then 2-2-2-2 ex, and so further. The goal is to keep track of the count and e.g. reach 10. When the mind wanders of, start again at 0. The mind will wander, just don’t lose complete track of the breath or the counting. Once you’ve reached 10 without issues, stop counting and just focus on the breath. 
- Take some more deep breaths
- Use "in-out" instead of counting the breaths

### 10 stages to meditation
1. Spend time daily to actively and wholeheartedly meditate 
2. Keeping the attention on the breath. This mainly consist of getting back to the breath when the mind starts wandering. The opposite is forgetting to get back to the breath, which is when meditation just doesn’t really work. The aim is to reduce the amount of time you spend mind wandering and focus the time spend on the meditation object
3.  Extending the period of attention and reduce the forgetting of getting back to the breath. Here, you start focusing on introspective attention as well – which is essentially become really aware of what is happening in your mind 

By the end of the 3rd stage, you’ve reached the first Milestone and are no longer a beginner. Now you can continuous attention to the meditation object without wind wandering or forgetting

4. Continuous attention and overcoming distraction and dullness – the breath is still main focus point and just focussing on the breath doesn’t lead to dullness
5. Get rid of subtle dullness essentially by doing even more introspective mindfulness work 
6. Single pointed attention to the meditation object

Second milestone reached: you can now focus on the breath without being distracted by the background and you aware of your state of mind in every moment 

7. Sustained and exclusive attention to any object but still havening to put in the effort 

Milestone 3: effortless stability of attention 

8. The only limitation is in how far you can physically stay in the same position 
9. No longer is your physical position a showstopper
10. When the mind is pretty much in meditative state even when not meditating 

Milestone 4: mastery of meditation
