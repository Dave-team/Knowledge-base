## Principles 
- Set up with a diet that is easy to follow. Calculate exactly how much you theoretically need and run the diet for 2 weeks 
- Count the calories you take. Try not to deviate from the diet as you already calculated everything there. If you eat something else, adjust your meals for the day 
- Time your meals: breakfast is the biggest meal of the day as the metabolism is quickest here. Then, meals get proportionally smaller. 
- Eat protein every 3-5 hours - the body’s anabolic response to protein lasts about that long. 
- Much of your carbs intake should come before and after training. Do not eat carbs before bed. The insulin created by the body to process and absorb carbs eaten stops the use of fat as an energy source, as well as hindering the production of growth hormone. Fats can be consumed throughout the day. 
- Cheat meals can speed up metabolic rate and should be kept to 1 or 2 per week. 
- 1 g of protein = 4 kcal. 1 g of carbs = 4 kcal. 1 g of fat = 9 kcal 

## Drinks
- Lots of water
- Lots of tea
- Matte
- Matcha
- Limit coffee (Heavy cream and MCT oil in morning coffee)

## Pre and post workout 
30 minutes before workout: 30 grams of high GI carbs, 30 grams of fast digesting protein (e.g. whey). Carbs for energy and triggers insulin which counteracts cortisol and increases blood flow to muscles and protein synthesis. Protein will get amino acids into blood stream, available for repair as you start breaking down muscle by lifting weights. 

Post workout meal. After training, the body is highly anabolic - it will absorb glucose, glycogen, and amino acids quicker than normally - it is a great time to eat a good meal. Note that this is only after weight lifting - cardio doesn’t deplete glycogen levels like weight lifting. Eat a substantial amount of cards (80 grams) and moderate protein. 

## Sources of nutrients
### Protein
Protein is required for growth: build and repair cells, produce hormones and enzymes and it requires it to keep the immune system functioning optimally. The more muscle you have, the more protein you need. 
Your body can only absorb 40-50 grams of protein per meal. So you can’t simply make up a lack of protein from e.g. missing a meal. Eat fast protein (e.g. protein shake) after a workout and eat slow protein (cottage cheese/ casein) before bed. 

**Protein foods**
Beef, eggs, fish (e.g. sardines), tuna, chicken, nuts, turkey, lean red meat, milk, cottage cheeses, yoghurt, tofu, quinoa, rice, (black) beans

### Carbs
Carbs are broken down into glucose and glycogen. Glucose is an energy source used by cells. Glycogen is a substance stored in liver and muscles that can easily be converted to glucose for immediate energy. When you work out, your body will use the glycogen to cope with the overload. The glycemic index shows how quickly carbs are converted into glucose in the body. A GI of 55 and under is considered low GI, 56 to 69 medium and 70 and above is considered as high GI. A simple carb is high on the GI index and gets converted into glucose quickly. A complex carb converts slowly and is low on the glycemic index. Eat GI index 70-90 food 30 minutes before and within 30 minutes after training. You’ll need the energy and afterwards you’ll need to restore the energy. All other carbs should be below GI of 60

**Carb foods**
Complex carbs: Broccoli, lettuce, fruits (bananas), some bread, tomatoes, oatmeal, brown rice, beans, lentils, sweet potatoes, multi grain bread, whole grain bread, basmati rice, strawberries, blackberries, orange 

### Fats
Fats help the body absorb nutrients, nourish the nervous system, help maintain cell structures, regulate hormone levels and more. The healthy fats are unsaturated, whereas the unhealthy fats are saturated fats or trans fats. Eating too many saturated fats (meat, dairy, egg yolks) can negatively affect cholesterol levels, so it should be eaten in moderation. Trans fat is scientifically modified saturated fat engineered for longer shelf lives, especially in packaged or frozen foods. Keep saturated fats below 10% of daily intake. Completely avoid trans fats. 

**Fat foods**
Nuts, seeds, oils (olive, sesame, flax seed, and others), animal fat (e.g. steak), avocados

### Other foods
**Fibre**: bread, beans, bananas, onions, oats, and broccoli.
**Vitamins**: eggs, liver, oil from fish, some fruits and vegetables, supplements 
**Minerals**: Salt, calcium, iron, aluminium, supplements, spinach 
**Other superfoods** Turmeric

## Nutrition principles by goal
There’s three goals: bulking, cutting and maintaining. Best practice generally for gaining muscle mass is to bulk till you are a bit bigger than you want and then cut as here you’ll lose some size. 

### Bulking
Starting point for bulking: 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, 2 grams of carbs, 1 gram of good fat per 3 pounds of body weight. How to check on your bulk: gain 0.5-2 pounds per week, with a minor increase in body fat. You should also be getting stronger weekly and see results in mirror and clothing. Also, good energy and good sleep. No strength / weight gain or less sleep: up calories by 300 (usually simply adding 70 grams of carbs). If you have a fast metabolism, you might need to increase your calorie intake by quite a bit. Up kcal intake by 200 for every 15 pounds you gain. 

### Fat loss
When dieting for fat loss, you’ll cut most calories coming from carbs. It’s more specific than bulking. You’re doing great when you lose 1-2 pounds per week with little or no strength loss. If you’re losing strength, you also lose muscle and your calories are probably too low. 
Start point: 1.2 gram of protein per pound. 1 gram of carbs per pound. 1 gram of fat per 5 pounds of body weight. Cutting is often done on a 500-600 calorie deficit every day. Judge progress by: weight, clothes fit, mirror, energy levels, strength, sleep, When the weight remains the same, yet your clothing feels looser, then you have gained muscle while losing fat. If energy is consistently down, eat more. Also after 2 weeks you shouldn’t really be hungry any longer. It’s normal for a little strength to drop, but it shouldn’t be more than 5% really. If adjustments are required, lower the kcal by 200 by dropping carbs. Otherwise applies the same when eating too little. Adjust your calories by 200 for every 15 pounds you lose. When cutting, have one day a week where you double the amount of regular carbs you’re eating. This will replenish glycogen levels in the muscles. 

### Maintenance 
Maintaining mass rules: 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. 1.5 grams of carbs per pounds of body weight. 1 gram of fat per 4 pounds of body weight. Indicators of progress: weight roughly the same, a little stronger each week, better mirror look and clothing fit. Good energy, good sleep. Again, make changes by taking or adding 50 grams of carbs (200 kcal)
