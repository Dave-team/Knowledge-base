# Growth 

## Principles
- Don’t try a bunch of channels at once. It takes serious time and effort to test a channel. It requires focus and iteration
- At the start, you really don’t need diversity in acquistion channels. Find any that really works for you and then optimize and milk out this channel before looking at another one. All successful companies had power law distribution in their channels where 80% of everything came from a select number of channels 
- In the early stages, prioritze speed of learning. This will probably mean some investment in paid channels 
- Growth is about always working on the highest impact area given limited resources. 
- Growth always changes:
  - You product changes
  - Your audiences changes (innovators, early adaptors, early majority, late majority, laggards) 
  - You channels change (Twitter isn’t so effective any more, remember MySpace?). Whatever channels work at any point in time don’t need to work at a later time 
- There is also tactic fatigue: 
  - A new tactic works well because its novel
  - Tactic is optimized
  - Others copy the tactic > widespread > lost its novelty 
  - After awhile, users block the tactic which causes effectiviness to decrease 
  - You want to be early with new channels, you have to work hard to maintain, constantly experiment, 
- Focus on retention first and foremost 
- Implement a good growth process 
- Once you have something that works, double down! 
- Marketing vs growth: marketing is focused on awareness and acquisition, whereas growth is focused on full funnel (AARRR) and has more impact on product. Hence: marketing, product, engineering, and data combination is the growth function 
- In general, really double down on the highest (potential) growth areas 
- Your job should always be to try and find (and double down) on the most recent untapped channels
- Always target your existing customers first 

## Bullseye / Traction model
Traction uses the Bullseye framework to get as quickly as possible to the best channel: brainstorm, rank, prioritize, test, focus on what works
**Brainstorm**: how could you use any of the traction channels? And don’t assume you can’t use some, because that’s simply not true. Create a spreadsheet with all channels and how you might use them. Brainstorm. As for research: how do or did other similar companies acquire users? And where did they lose a lot of marketing spent?
 
For each idea (educated guesses where applicable) :
- How probable does it seem that this idea could work (1–5)?
- What is the expected cost to acquire a customer through this idea
- How many customers can you expect to acquire at that cost (before saturation)?
- What is the timeframe needed to run tests?
 
**Rank**: Place each of the traction channels into one of three columns, with each column representing a concentric circle in the Bullseye:
 
Column A (Inner Circle): which traction channels seem most promising right now?
Column B (Potential): which traction channels seem like they could possibly work?
Column C (Long-shot): which traction channels seem like long-shots?
 
**Prioritize**: from the channels in column A, pick 3. These make everyone’s head boil and seem the best way to move forward.
 
**Test**: here you test the channels selected before – using cheap tests. Questions to answer:
1. Roughly how much will it cost to acquire customers through this channel?
2. How many customers do you think are available through this channel?
3. Are the customers that you are getting through this channel the ones that you want right now? Possibly also include the LTV in the spreadsheet
 
At this stage, don’t try to get a lot of users, try to find something that works well quickly. You want to confirm your assumptions.
 
**Focus**: from your channels, you realize that one works best. Then, simply optimize the hell out of that channel. At some point, the channel with max out. Then, repeat the entire process and go for a different channel.

In the early stages, the time split should be 50-50% between both product development as well as testing traction strategies. The Bullseye model or framework is perfect in combination with the Lean framework. With Lean, you have a good product development strategy, increasing the chance of building a good product. With Bullseye, you are more likely to create a good distribution channel with the traction development methodology

Both help address major risks that face early stage companies: market risk (that you can reach customers in a sustainable way) and product risk (that customers want what you’re building), respectively.

When testing the channels, you’re looking for channels that are moving the needle: they have measurable, significant impact on the business. 
 
After you have been testing channels with minimum budget and found some that works, start playing around with A/B testing to start optimizing the results from the channels. 

## Growth transition phases 
**Phase 1 = Traction**
Goal = find product-market fit among some customer segment
Metric = retention. If you don’t retain users, nothing else matters 
Volume = get steady number of users through the door. Do not run tests – the volume will be too small. 
Channels = try multiple (probably 2 or 3 after your channel prioritization process). See what works. Focus on those 
Optimization = only make large changes as the sample sizes are small 

**Phase 2 = Transition**
Goal = understand growth levers for the business. If north star metric is DAU, know how you can increase this metric 
Metric = Weekly/Monthly growth rates. Start looking at CPA and LTV
Volume = invest more in acquisition but be mindful of the LTV as you acquire more 
Channels = focus, don’t diversify. Double down on what works and focus on team and process first
Optimization = still mainly macro changes though the sample sizes have significantly increased

**Phase 3 = Growth**
Goal = get the north star metrics up
Metric = growth rates, but now also look at the actual payback period. Payback period tends to increase with competition, saturated channels. 
Volume = all in 
Channels = still focus on the one primary channel. However, you should now have a growth process. More resources and capital. Also may saturate primary channel. Now it’s the right time to start exploring 
Optimization = micro.

## Growth strategies
- Market Penetration = existing market; existing products 
- Market Development = new markets; existing products
- Product Development = new markets; new products 
- Diversification = new markets; new products

Marketing Strategy 
- STP
  - Segmentation = Dividing a market into different categories
  - Targeting = Evaluating market segment’s and entering them
  - Positioning = Position a clear and desirable place for the product in the minds of the customers (relative to competitor’s products)
- Marketing Mix
  - Product
  - Price
  - Place
  - Promotion  

## Growth process notes
Categorize backlog of ideas by using the AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referrals, Revenue). Then we give every idea a score from 1 to 10 by using the “- ” system. -  stands for Impact, Confidence and Ease of execution:
- Impact. If this idea works, how much impact will it have?
- Confidence. How confident are you that this idea will work?
- Ease. Is this idea something that will be easy to test?

The average score from the -  framework determines what ideas to focus on first.
The idea backlog can look as follows:
1. Idea name - <50 characters
2. Idea description - who, what, where, when and how?
3. Hypothesis
4. Metrics to be measured to identify whether there was success or not 

With experiments, you can have vision documents with the following information: 
1. A Summary of the Experiment — Limited to one or two short paragraphs.
2. Hypothesis — Following the formula described above.
3. Success Metrics — Always tied to specific numbers and vetted by our data analysts.
4. Timeframe — An ETA to get started and an estimation of how long the test must run.
5. Tasks — High-level project needs that help each stakeholder know their role.
6. Notes — Usually questions that need to be thought about before the test starts

Key principle: research, hypothesize, prioritize, experiment, analyze … repeat.

Growth process. Every time you’ve completed an experiment: 
- Experiment analysis? What happened? What changes did we see in the numbers? How is that in line with the prediction? Also: Why did this happen? Why did the experiment succeed or fail?  
- Sharing the learnings: the experiment analysis is shared throughout the company – ensuring the history of learnings are available to all 
- Apply the learntings: how can the learnings be applied moving forwards? Either adding new experiemnts to backlog based of learnings or adjusting priorities of experiments based on experiences 
- Weekly meeting discussing the learnings gained from the experiment and why the focus is on those experiments for the coming week. Focusing on the what is not the best use of your time during these meetings. Put all of this e.g. in a pipeline instead with links to the actual experiments docs. If someone has comments or questions about the specific experiments, encourage them to ask these e.g. via a different Google doc. Send a automated reminder pre meeting for all to add their learnings to a learnings doc. Pre meeting everyone reviews experiment pipeline and last weeks metrics to be up to date. If things need to be discussed, there’s room for that but otherwise discussing the what is not the best use of anyone’s time. 

## 3 Ps of getting visitors 
**PULL**
The first way to get visitors to your site is to pull them in. This is where you give them a reason to come to you. You ent-  them, incentivize them, and draw them to you. This book is an example of the pull methodology. You were drawn to us. We didn’t have to go find you online, but rather, you found us.

Tactics 
These tactics revolve around providing something of value that ent- s people to visit your site. If you stop providing value then you’ll stop pulling them in.
- Blogging or guest blogging
- SEO (from a content perspective and from a coding perspective)
- Social media including extremely good customer serv- , which will drive many people to the product
- Contests
- Leverage other’s peoples audiences 

**PUSH**
As the name implies, this is a bit more aggressive than pulling. Instead of enticing people, you just go get them and push them onto your site. Someone may be wanting to watch a YouTube video, but not until they see your ad. They may want to do a Google search, but not until they see your paid result. You go out and find where they are online and you push them towards your product.

Tactics
Other than pull tactics, push tactics actually costs money.  
- Purchase ads (e.g. paid search, display, paid social)
- Promo swap (can be free, just swap things with other companies)
- Affiliates
- Direct Sales

**PRODUCT**
The third way that traffic can end up on your site is through the product itself. If you’ve ever invited your friends to a new social network, then you understand how a product can be used to get new traffic. Everyone that uses the product gets more people to use the product.

Tactics
Product tactics essentially should amplify everything that comes into your funnel and a related factor is the K factor. At K-factor of .5 would mean that for every visitor, they bring another 0.5 visitor. 
1.	Refer a friend (phone book, email contacts, social media)
2.	Social sharing (people sharing about your product on facebook). This can be especially helpful e.g. with blogs
3.	API integrations (e.g. like Spotify did with facebook)
4.	Backlinks
5.	Incentives (e.g. Dropbox’s free storage offer)
6.	Organic worth of mouth

## Retention tactics
- Staged traffic: rather than spending the entire budget on getting visitors to the website, a big chuck of your effort should be to spend a little on getting visitors first, see what their actions are, adapt and then invest more in marketing again. 
- Speed up to the ‘aha moment’. E.g. Twitter speeded up their moment to aha by really pushing people to follow at least 20 people after sign-up
- Email campaigns
  - Drip campaigns, essentially same as onboarding campaign
  - Event based notification (Facebook telling you that someone messaged you, but you actually need to go back to Facebook to see the message)
  - General updates
- Alerts and notifications. Important to remember is that people can always turn it off if they don’t actually want this stuff. 
- Exit interviews/surveys: you’ve already lost them so you might as well try to get them back
- Have a red carpet for the longest/best users: threat them better, give them something extra
- Community building

## Deciding on acquisition channel 
1. List all possible channels
2. Set up weighting factors:
   1. Targeting - The depth of ability to target different audiences.  
   2. Cost - The upfront and ongoing cost to acquire users in this channel.  
   3. Input Time - The upfront time required to start running experiments with this channel.
   4. Output Time  - The time it takes to start getting data around your experiments.  
   5. Control - The control you have over turning the channel on/off at will.
   6. Scale - The size/reach of the channel.  
3. Another source mentions these:
   1. Potential impact
   2. Odds of success 
   3. Budget requirements 
   4. Estimated ROI
   5. Effort 
4. Research each channel so you can score them with low/med/high (1,2,3 better presumably)
5. Start experimenting with the best option according to what you are currently optimizing for as well the constraints you are dealing with. Do this like this:
   1. Tactic: what experiement are you running?
   2. Goal: what is the end goal of the experiment?
   3. Process: clear outline of how you are going about the experiment 
   4. Metrics: what should we be tracking?
   5. Success: what numbers should we hit to see something as being successfull?  

## Marketing plan
1. Audience
   1. Demographics (age, gender, income, marital status, ethnicity)
   2. Psychographics (activities, personality, values, attitudes)
   3. Geographics: location, density, distribution)
   4. Behavioral: benefits, usage rates, patterns, use cases 
2. Problem: what problems are you solving?
3. Market: are you capturing a new or existing market? 
4. Existing solutions: how does the audience make decisions / solve this today?
5. Channels: what channels have your audience’s attention today?
6. Position: what do we stand for and against? 
7. Message: simple, memorable, compelling and focused on emotions 

## Other
**Chicken and egg problems**
1. Platforms / Marketplaces: the value to each group is dependent on the use of the other group. Solution: create value for one group of users that is not dependent on the other group of users. Be an app before you can be a platform or marketplace
2. Communities / Social networks: the value to each individual user grows the more users are in the overall community. Solution: decrease the size of your target audience in order to make it easier to get density 
3. Work your ass off to make it work – MySpace spammed people and Yelp paid reviewers. Something we just need to do the painful things 

**Law of shitty click-throughs**
Over time, all marketing strategies result in shitty click-through rates. Because of this, it is important to keep experimenting with different channels and keep up to date with anything that is new on the market - doing the new thing means there is less competition, making it more effective and cheaper (more bidding/demand drives the price up for the specific advertising channels). 

**Critical marketing path**
Companies should have traction goals that are relevant and in line with the stage a company is in at any given time. The goal could be 100 users. Generally, the first goal is to get to a significant amount of users who are trying your product, then it’s customers sticking with / recommending your product which implies product market fit. And then a goal could be a break-even point: i.e. we need so many users/transactions, whatever to reach break-even. 
After the traction goal is established, define the critical path: what is the absolute essential things that need to be done in order to achieve the traction goal? This can be product related, or even process related. So the critical path are the essential milestones that need to be reached. These milestones should be prioritized, e.g. looking at dependencies or highest impact. This allows for extreme focus within the company 

## Market research
Competitive research
- First steps
  - Define the problem and potential target market
  - Test whether it is a real problem (blogs, etc.)
  - Test whether the target market is correct (ask them)
  - Build a solution based on these impressions
  - Test whether the solution solves the problem for the target market
  - Build the product
- Desk research 
  - Google keyword search (paid and organic check)	
  - Crunchbase
  - Alexa
  - SimilarWeb
  - Google News and Google Trends and Google Keywords Tool
  - SEMrush
  - SpyFu
  - startupli.st
- Primary research
  - Use personas to analyze competition
  - Interviews
  - Surveys
- To find whether a market is interesting, make use of the Google Keyword tool 	and identify the # searches there are in the field related to the product you are about to be building. 
- Always remember that competition is often good: understand that there is a  market and the marketing effort of the competition raise demand for the  product. Just make sure that more % of that additional and total demand comes your way.
