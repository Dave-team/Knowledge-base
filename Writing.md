# Writing
- Find a subject you care about
- Write version 1 as soon/fast as you can 
- Do not ramble
- Keep it simple – as if you were to write to a 10 year old
- Cut out as much as you can and focus purely on what matters most. If words don’t add value, cut them out  
- Sound like yourself – write similarly to how you speak 
- Say what you mean to say 
- Business writing is about clarity and persuasion 
- Make sure the first sentence grabs the reader
- Write short sentences
- Avoid putting multiple thoughts in a sentence
