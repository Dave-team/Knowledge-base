Life brings challenges. Be enthusiastic, optimistic and confident we can figure things out

Don't assume things to be true. Check for yourself and clarify with others 

Be curious

To live by: 
- At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
- What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
- You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
- Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway
- The days are long but the decades are short 
- No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
- Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
- Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
- Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
- The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
- Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it  
- See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
- We survive and conquer one day after the next and we try to make each day better than the last. We also never know what is going to happen and that is exciting. This is what makes life worth living.
