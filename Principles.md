## Important elements of life 
There are 7 things that matter most in my life: family, love, friends, health, career, experiences, personal goals & hobbies. It is important these are all in balance and that you have a vision for them. With this vision, it's easy to figure out what you should be spending your time on. By thinking about what really matters, you can stop chasing that which doesn’t really matter and start living a much fuller life 

And any big decision within these areas is very influential to my life so spend a lot of time thinking about them (where you love, who you're with and what you do). If you can't decide, the answer is no. If you need a spreadsheet to list pros and cons, forget about it - don't do it. The hardest thing is not doing what you want—it’s knowing what you want.

You want to be able to seperate from your mind and look at yourself objectively. Most people are trapped in their own heads. 
The end goal is to live a simple life. 
The default state should be: this is great – let’s make the most of the situation at hand


Have a personal philosophy and then live by it. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life.
- Who you want to be (character and values) 
- What you want to achieve and contribute


### Family
- Always be there for the family and be responsible
- Show that you care
- Appreciate them 
- Do fun things

### Love
- Be the best partner I can be 
- Always be present - separate work stress from private time
- Show that you care 
- Do fun things and take initiative here  
- Communicate feelings 

### Friends
- Meet at least 1 friend a week 
- Make a commitment to stay in touch with friends globally 
- Be interested and meet new people. Everybody could be a potential great friend 
- Add value to the lives of others
- Be nice to strangers

### Health
- Physical activity: Extremely fit: flexible, strong endurance, speed and strength
- Heathy diet: Eat healthy and drinks lots of water. Take supplements and eat lots of fruits and veg. Cook meals fresh as much as possible  
- Get good quality sleep
- Take care of appearance/body/skin and hygiene 
- Good ergonomic posture and general confident body language 

### Mental 
- Being in the present moment through mindfulness and meditation 
- In touch with my feelings through CBT, journalling and reflection
- Mind development through reading, curiosity 

### Career
- Act as if I'm Head of BI: have the confidence and take the ownership that comes with the role
- Regularly reflect on the development goals and make sure I'm on top of it. 
- Be enthusiastic and energetic around creating impact
- Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism - be confident we can figure things out 
- Be resourceful, solution oriented and curious
- Build meaningful relationships 
- Be social. Be enthusiastic, show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me. Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose

### Experiences 
- Travel
- Fulfil bucket list 
- Do things that create lasting memories
- Get many 'highs' in your life and be in the moment to fully appreciate them 
- Experience and explore more 

### Personal goals & hobbies 
- Set goals and work towards them for extended periods of time. Make your life a book with chapters worth reading 
- Have hobbies that you enjoy doing - this will make me a confident and interesting person. To find those hobbies, pick up something (anything), do it for an extended amount of time, try to become better at it and see how it sticks - more than anything, be curious around the thing you're learning/doing
- Do things for the sake of doing them only - just because you want to. There is no goal, there is no real reason - you just want to do it. They're no checklists to tick off. The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way, the more present you are and the happier you’ll feel 
- Have bigger things going on for you beyond work: have hobbies, work out, work towards achieving goals. 
- When feeling unproductive, realize why you're doing this: wanting to become a more well rounded person. Be relaxed and in the moment. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.  
- Do small things and enjoy them. Be mindful when watering the plants, think about the food when cooking. Enjoy the environment when walking outside. And then celebrate what you have achieved. 
- To foster passion:
  - What do I like to think about?
  - Where does my mind wander?
  - What do I really care about?
  - What matters most to me?
  - How do I enjoy spending my time?
  - What did I enjoy when I was younger? 
- Hobbies that work well for me: Where I enjoy the process. I.e. not just liking the idea of being good at something, but visualizing that I'll also enjoy the process. 
- A main part in my belief system is that of balance. It’s not about doing something 100% and only ever doing that. It’s about making time for many different things
- Bring my strenths to activites. I tend to learn and analyze. E.g. bring skills to fiction. Learn character development, understand the language and the building of sentences.

## The pyramid to achieving the right things
- Personal manisfesto: what's most important in my life? Who you are, what you stand for, what you want out of life?
- (Vision: where do I want the year to go?)
- Goals: what projects are required to reach the vision?
- Projects: tracking the things I'm working on?
- Habits: what do I do on a daily basis to get me closer to where I want to be?

## Happiness and purpose
### What is happiness? 
Contentment is a state of fullfilment. It's the absence of anxiety, fear and desires and it's about being present and not stuck in your own head. Happiness is contentment in motion - when something happens you really enjoy. Sitting by yourself is not happiness, it's contentment. 

You can then accept the current state of things and he more present we are, the happier we’ll be. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something. In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence and really embrace the present moment and the reality of what is then you are content, and you are happy.

### How to achieve happiness
- Realize its a choice and we can prioritize it above everything else. It’s about finding things we do that gives us internal peace/contentment and we need to trial with these things until we find something that works for us and just making a commitment to ourselves to be a happier person.  
- To achieve this contentment, throw away any expectations or grand goals you may have. Each goal will lead to another and misses the point of being present.
- Believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self. Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You’re just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute. Every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way. Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work.
- Be more grateful: “Stop asking why and start saying wow.” The world is such an amazing place. As humans, we’re used to taking everything for granted.
- 
- Find happiness in acceptance. Rather than striving for something or wanting to solve problems, get peace on the inside by accepting the ways things just are. What can help with this: 
  - Embrace death. It's coming and you can't run from it. More generally, let go of what you can't control
  - It’s okay whatever the outcome is. 
  - We don’t always get what we want, but sometimes what is happening is for the best. The sooner you can accept it as a reality, the sooner you can adapt to it.
  - To accept: step back and look at previous bits of suffering I’ve had in my life. Write them down and ask what happened? 

Practical techniques for happiness: 
- Mindfullness: meditation, yoga, hobbies that create a state of relaxation 
- Expressing your feelings (with others, in therapy, in a journal, through art)
- Spending time with happy people
- Read great books 
- Smile more often 
- Get more sunlight 
- Working out 
- Reduce screen and social media time
- It’s the news’ job to make you anxious and angry. But its underlying scientific, economic, education, and conflict trends are positive. Stay optimistic. 
- Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody or being annoyed by something, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?" Even if you can’t come up with something positive, you can say, “Well, the Universe is going to teach me something now. Now I get to listen and learn.”
- Making other people happy is probably a great way to guarantee personal happiness also. Help other get ahead first. Give and add value and don’t want/expect anything in return 
- Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day. 
- A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest? 
- Remove any should from your life. Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate them

## Meaning of life 
Meaning to life is personal and the key is to be happy in the moment. I don’t think there is any end goal or purpose. I’m just living life as I want to. I’m literally just doing it moment to moment.

Answer 2: There is no meaning to life. The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the Universe, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the next 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe. Anything you do will fade. It will disappear,

We seem happiest when we’re socialising with other people, outside or doing something that seems meaningful to us such as excercising and volunteering (effective altruism, focus on wife/kids, solve problems to better the world and make life better for others, perform and learn about arts, study philosophy and spirituality, get to know your inner psyche). Sometimes meaning of life comes from things are inherently worthless. Learn an instrument, buy a motorcycle, make a painting, become a scuba instructor, run a marathon, try drugs, move to another country, sit at a park/cafe and talk with people. Spice up and really experience life.

Life is like a piece of music. The "point" of listening to it lies in the listening - not the getting to the end of the track. If you build and optimize your life around "getting to the end" - whatever that has meant for you, getting a degree, reaching a certain amount of wealth, a certain amount of success, a certain kind of partner, etc. - you will eventually find that there is no more "end" to get to. Well, the way out of this is really stupid - you just have to learn to enjoy the music instead of always looking forward to reaching the end of the track.

The goals we should strive for are those that have no endpoint, just continuous honing of a craft. Fatherhood is an example - there’s no “endpoint” - you find meaning from being an ever greater father.

## General 
- Build character and get a thicker skin: 
    - Hardship and setbacks are a part of life. We need to deal with and accept this reality. Not everything is about roses and moonshine. We need to deal with the cards we’re given. We need to go on and not be stuck in the past.
    - Character is having gone through hard times and coming out on top
    - Get uncomfortable more often
    - Seek out criticism
    - You always want to see the reality, the way things are. This is hard because we have preconceived notions around how things should be. When something bad happens, we then suffer because we’ve been putting off reality – we’ve been hiding it from ourselves. The moment of suffering then is a moment of truth. It is a moment where you’re forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. -	The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality (.e.g advising a friend of a breakup being in it yourself)
    - Choose short term pain in order to get longer term happiness 
    - When there’s pain, it means there is something to learn. The more you deal and face the pain, the more you learn and the better you become at encountering similar or even heavier pains. 
    - Think of life as a puzzle: every challenge you solve is a principle that helps avoid the same sort of problem in the future
    - Pain + reflection = Progress
- Spend time with great people 
    - You are the average of the five people you spend most time with
    - Visualize how others would handle situations and emulate these situations (Naval, Paul G, Jocko)
- Become more well rounded (practice curiosity in a great many fields). 
    - Find and watch interesting documentaries and films: Reddit and Google for inspiration. Get to know the actors/producers better
    - Explore more music: Spotify playlists, Reddit, forums. Get to know and remember the artists better
    - Read fiction, short stories, poetry and generally just a lot of different topics. 
    - Learn about lots of different topics: psychology, design, biology, history, micro economics, persuasion, mathematics, science, game theory
    - Watch and learn more about people I admire - watch them present / read their interviews etc.  
    - Work on projects 
    - Pick up calming hobbies: puzzles, video games, colouring books, play an instrument, chess 
    - Dive into Wikipedia
    - Practice Martial Arts
    - Practice creativity/arts: colouring, sketching, play an instrument, sing, dance
    - Take walks in inspirational places (museums, nature, new cities)
    - Imagine being a role model for others and they look up to what I say. Be a great speaker, writer, be well rounded as they'll ask a wide range of different interesting questions and have opinions whilst being calm and confident. Foster these opinions can reflecting how I feel about things: What did I think of this meal? Of this film? Why do I think this - what makes it such and how does it compare to other things? 
    - Take at least one day a week where you just have time to think. It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. 
- What life is about:
    - Becoming better at things (and just becoming a better person): in life, try to become good at things you enjoy doing and be experimental. Six month sprints to try to become good at e.g. dancing, boxing, chess, badminton - this will slow time. Same for personal projects. Get better at things by caring a lot and focusing on constantly getting better
    - Being calm, in the moment and enjoying the little things in life 
    - We don't know what tomorrow will bring which is exciting. And then we'll always aim to make today better than yesterday and face the days with great enthusiasm. 
    - Creating lasting memories with people we love 
    - Family, friends, love, experiences, health, career and other than those, it's the little things: sex, hugs, nice drinks, good food, good books / films, good workouts
    - "Life is not a problem to solve but a reality to experiencence"
- Be experimental in life: try things and test if they improve my quality of life  
- Think bigger picture: it’s not about where you are currently; it is about where you are going. By focusing on the bigger picture, you realize your current problem is tiny in the grand scheme of things
- Even when you are doing everything well and have achieved great things, you may still be lost. If that is the case, go from doing things for yourself to helping others. This is where real fulfillment lies 
- Be able to switch mindset and focus depending on the surrounding. I.e. never taking my shit to places where it shouldn’t be – collect your headaches and shift the right gears
- Don’t assume things, just go with the flow instead. Don’t overthink and don't try to control everything. Instead, open your heart and see what happens - allow yourself to be vulnerable. 
- Just tell yourself: it’s okay. I’ve got this. All will be well. 
- We want freedom. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don’t want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. Once you can solve your money problems, either by lowering your lifestyle or by making enough money, you want to retire. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.
- In every situation, no matter how bad it is, ask yourself: in which way can I turn this around to make it positive for me? Or: why is this a good thing? Interpret everything as positively for yourself. Remember that the brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality 
- Sometimes there are uncomfortable situations and you just need to delve into them. E.g. at an airplane with babies shouting in both ears. Really feel the emotions and study them objectively. You will quickly get used to being in discomfort. Get out of your comfort zone
- Each day is day one and each breath is a new arrival

## To live by: 
- What's important in life: 
    - At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
    - What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
    - You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
    - There is no such thing as enough achievement to then say 'I am now ready to live'. Keep busy with anything other than the fundamental parts of living a good life is just procrastion to living that later will cause regret. 
    - Be grateful if the body and what we can do with it because one day well no longer be able to
- Life is short: 
    - You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
    - Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway and I'm really not the centre of the universe
    - The days are long but the decades are short 
    - Life passes most people by while they’re making plans for it
    - Work to live, don’t live to work.
    - Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years
    - It's a mirable that we're alive in the first place 
    - Each day is a new start. Each breath is a new start to become the person you want to be
    - Every hour more in your life is but a privilege so make the very best of it, for time is limited in our lives. Threat time with others as possibly the last time you have with them. We will all be gone soon and so will the ones we love the most. 
    - Simply realize that none of this ultimately matters at all. Once you realize that, you can see through the game and relax. 
- You and you alone are responsible:     
    - No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
    - Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
    - Life is hard and will throw you many challenges. You survive them, learn from them and move on. You build character comprised of everything that happened in your life. Anything that happens should be seen as a lesson you can use to become better. 
    - We have the ability to choose how we respond to everything. It’s not what happens to us that hurts us, but our response that hurts us 
    - Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life
    - Don’t worry about whether you like your current situation or not. Life doesn’t care about what you do and don’t like. It’s up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do and then power that all the way through. 
    - See yourself as a machine – there is a worker in the machine and there is a designer of the machine. It’s much more important to be a good designer/manager of your life than being a worker in it. E.g. the designer needs to identify the workers strengths and weaknesses and adjust accordingly either by working on the weaknesses (best option but only if fixing the weakness is within your nature), or working around them(e.g. hiring others). It is naïve to think you can do most things perfectly or even very well  
- Relationships are incredibly important
    - Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
    - Be someone others would like to be around with
    - Family and loved ones will at some point die. Make very sure you did what you could do at any point to show that you love and care for them
- Become a better version of yourself 
    - Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
    - See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
    - Learn to operate within your circle of competence. What is crucial is the you understand the boundaries of that circle and the size of the circle is irrelevant. Honestly define what you know and then stick to those areas. If you're outside, say 'I don't know'  
    - Strong opinions, loosely held 
    - Live with a feedback loop: reflect on how you did something and then think about how it should have been done better so that can be done next time 
    - Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
    - Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
- Live a meaningful life: 
    - The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
    - Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it  
    - Don't expect much so there is little disappointment. What you desire most ends up owing you
- After breakup message: I’m 27. There really is more than enough time to find someone and settle down, get married and have kids. And before that, enjoy your time being single. Focus on advancing your career, become this more social person, make new friends, pursue new hobbies and just generally really be more of an independent man with character who is happy with who he is. Someone who isn’t obsessed around getting a response from someone else. Someone who lets go of things he doesn’t control. Someone who leads by example. You cannot depend on a relationship for happiness because one way or another, things will mess up. So ALWAYS live an independent happy life - then if someone joins that life, all the better. Just do not change for anything or anyone

## Life experiment framework
- Observations—What are you observing in your life or business that you want to improve?
- Knowns—What have you learned from past Experiments that might be related to your observations?
- Hypotheses—Based on what you’ve observed, what situations or factors might cause or contribute to your observations?
- Tests—What will you try or change to improve your situation? Which hypotheses will this experiment Test?
- Results—What happened after each Test? Does it support or disconfirm the hypothesis?

Here are a few questions to help you discover things worth Testing:
- How much sleep do you need to feel rested and alert?
- Which foods make you feel energetic after eating? Which foods make you feel ill or lethargic?
- When do you do your most productive work? Are there any patterns in your productivity?
- When do you get your best ideas? What are you doing when they occur to you?
- What is your biggest source of stress or concern? When do you start worrying, and why?

Consciously change your approach to one of these areas of your life and Externalize your results. If you find a change useful, keep doing it—if not, stop doing it and try something else. Testing is the best way to ensure that your life gets better over time. By constantly trying new things, you’re learning what works for you and what doesn’t. Over time, you’ll discover Patterns—things that make your life better and things that make your life worse. The results of your Experiments Accumulate, until they inevitably produce the results you want.
