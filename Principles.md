## Important elements of life 
There are 7 things that matter most in my life: family, love, friends, health, career, experiences, personal goals & hobbies. It is important these are all in balance. And any big decision within these areas is very influential to my life so spend a lot of time thinking about them (where you love, who you're with and what you do). If you can't decide, the answer is no. If you need a spreadsheet to list pros and cons, forget about it - don't do it. 

### Family

### Experiences

- Do things that create lasting memories
- Get many 'highs' in your life and be in the moment to fully appreciate them 
- Experience and explore more 

### Personal goals & hobbies 
- Set goals and work towards them for extended periods of time. Make your life a book with chapters worth reading 
- Have hobbies that you enjoy doing - this will make me a confident and interesting person. To find those hobbies, pick up something (anything), do it for an extended amount of time, try to become better at it and see how it sticks - more than anything, be curious around the thing you're learning/doing
- Do things for the sake of doing them only - just because you want to. There is no goal, there is no real reason - you just want to do it. They're no checklists to tick off
- Have bigger things going on for you beyond work: have hobbies, work out, work towards achieving goals. 
- When feeling unproductive, realize why you're doing this: wanting to become a more well rounded person. Be relaxed and in the moment. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.  
- Do small things and enjoy them. Be mindful when watering the plants, think about the food when cooking. Enjoy the environment when walking outside. And then celebrate what you have achieved. 
- To foster passion:
  - What do I like to think about?
  - Where does my mind wander?
  - What do I really care about?
  - What matters most to me?
  - How do I enjoy spending my time?
  - What did I enjoy when I was younger?

## Happiness and purpose
### What is happiness? 
Contentment is a state of fullfilment. It's the absence of anxiety, fear and desires and it's about being present and not stuck in your own head. Happiness is contentment in motion - when something happens you really enjoy. Sitting by yourself is not happiness, it's contentment. 

You can then accept the current state of things and he more present we are, the happier we’ll be. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something. In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence and really embrace the present moment and the reality of what is then you are content, and you are happy.

### How to achieve happiness
- Realize its a choice and we can prioritize it above everything else. It’s about finding things we do that gives us internal peace/contentment and we need to trial with these things until we find something that works for us and just making a commitment to ourselves to be a happier person.  
- To achieve this contentment, throw away any expectations or grand goals you may have. Each goal will lead to another and misses the point of being present.
- Believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self. Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You’re just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute. Every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way. Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work.
- Be more grateful: “Stop asking why and start saying wow.” The world is such an amazing place. As humans, we’re used to taking everything for granted.
- 
- Find happiness in acceptance. Rather than striving for something or wanting to solve problems, get peace on the inside by accepting the ways things just are. What can help with this: 
  - Embrace death. It's coming and you can't run from it. More generally, let go of what you can't control
  - It’s okay whatever the outcome is. 
  - We don’t always get what we want, but sometimes what is happening is for the best. The sooner you can accept it as a reality, the sooner you can adapt to it.

Practical techniques for happiness: 
- Mindfullness: meditation, yoga, hobbies that create a state of relaxation 
- Expressing your feelings (with others, in therapy, in a journal, through art)
- Spending time with happy people
- Smile more often 
- Get more sunlight 
- Working out 
- Reduce screen and social media time
- Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody or being annoyed by something, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?
- Making other people happy is probably a great way to guarantee personal happiness also. Help other get ahead first. Give and add value and don’t want/expect anything in return 

## Meaning of life 
Meaning to life is personal and the key is to be happy in the moment 
We seem happiest when we’re socialising with other people, outside or doing something that seems meaningful to us such as excercising and volunteering (effective altruism, focus on wife/kids, solve problems to better the world and make life better for others, perform and learn about arts, study philosophy and spirituality, get to know your inner psyche). Sometimes meaning of life comes from things are inherently worthless. Learn an instrument, buy a motorcycle, make a painting, become a scuba instructor, run a marathon, try drugs, move to another country, sit at a park/cafe and talk with people. Spice up and really experience life.

Life is like a piece of music. The "point" of listening to it lies in the listening - not the getting to the end of the track. If you build and optimize your life around "getting to the end" - whatever that has meant for you, getting a degree, reaching a certain amount of wealth, a certain amount of success, a certain kind of partner, etc. - you will eventually find that there is no more "end" to get to. Well, the way out of this is really stupid - you just have to learn to enjoy the music instead of always looking forward to reaching the end of the track.

The goals we should strive for are those that have no endpoint, just continuous honing of a craft. Fatherhood is an example - there’s no “endpoint” - you find meaning from being an ever greater father.

## General 
- Build character and get a thicker skin: 
    - Hardship and setbacks are a part of life. We need to deal with and accept this reality. Not everything is about roses and moonshine. We need to deal with the cards we’re given. We need to go on and not be stuck in the past.
    - Character is having gone through hard times and coming out on top
    - Get uncomfortable more often
    - Seek out criticism
- Spend time with great people 
    - You are the average of the five people you spend most time with
    - Visualize how others would handle situations and emulate these situations (Naval, Paul G, Jocko)
- Become more well rounded (practice curiosity in a great many fields). 
    - Find and watch interesting documentaries and films: Reddit and Google for inspiration. Get to know the actors/producers better
    - Explore more music: Spotify playlists, Reddit, forums. Get to know and remember the artists better
    - Read fiction, short stories, poetry and generally just a lot of different topics. 
    - Learn about lots of different topics: psychology, design, biology, history, micro economics, persuasion, mathematics, science, game theory
    - Watch and learn more about people I admire - watch them present / read their interviews etc.  
    - Work on projects 
    - Pick up calming hobbies: puzzles, video games, colouring books, play an instrument, chess 
    - Dive into Wikipedia
    - Practice Martial Arts
    - Practice creativity/arts: colouring, sketching, play an instrument, sing, dance
    - Take walks in inspirational places (museums, nature, new cities)
    - Imagine being a role model for others and they look up to what I say. Be a great speaker, writer, be well rounded as they'll ask a wide range of different interesting questions and have opinions whilst being calm and confident. Foster these opinions can reflecting how I feel about things: What did I think of this meal? Of this film? Why do I think this - what makes it such and how does it compare to other things? 
    - Take at least one day a week where you just have time to think. It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. 
- What life is about:
    - Becoming better at things (and just becoming a better person): in life, try to become good at things you enjoy doing and be experimental. Six month sprints to try to become good at e.g. dancing, boxing, chess, badminton - this will slow time. Same for personal projects. Get better at things by caring a lot and focusing on constantly getting better
    - Being calm, in the moment and enjoying the little things in life 
    - We don't know what tomorrow will bring which is exciting. And then we'll always aim to make today better than yesterday and face the days with great enthusiasm. 
    - Creating lasting memories with people we love 
    - Family, friends, love, experiences, health, career and other than those, it's the little things: sex, hugs, nice drinks, good food, good books / films, good workouts
- Be experimental in life: try things and test if they improve my quality of life  
- Think bigger picture: it’s not about where you are currently; it is about where you are going. By focusing on the bigger picture, you realize your current problem is tiny in the grand scheme of things
- Even when you are doing everything well and have achieved great things, you may still be lost. If that is the case, go from doing things for yourself to helping others. This is where real fulfillment lies 
- Be able to switch mindset and focus depending on the surrounding. I.e. never taking my shit to places where it shouldn’t be – collect your headaches and shift the right gears
- Don’t assume things, just go with the flow instead. Don’t overthink and don't try to control everything. Instead, open your heart and see what happens - allow yourself to be vulnerable. 
- Just tell yourself: it’s okay. I’ve got this. All will be well. 

## To live by: 
- What's important in life: 
    - At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
    - What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
    - You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
    - There is no such thing as enough achievement to then say 'I am now ready to live'. Keep busy with anything other than the fundamental parts of living a good life is just procrastion to living that later will cause regret. 
- Life is short: 
    - You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
    - Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway
    - The days are long but the decades are short 
    - Life passes most people by while they’re making plans for it
    - Work to live, don’t live to work.
    - Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years
    - It's a mirable that we're alive in the first place 
- You and you alone are responsible:     
    - No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
    - Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
    - Life is hard and will throw you many challenges. You survive them, learn from them and move on. You build character comprised of everything that happened in your life. Anything that happens should be seen as a lesson you can use to become better. 
- Relationships are incredibly important
    - Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
    - Be someone others would like to be around with
- Become a better version of yourself 
    - Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
    - See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
    - Learn to operate within your circle of competence. What is crucial is the you understand the boundaries of that circle and the size of the circle is irrelevant. Honestly define what you know and then stick to those areas. If you're outside, say 'I don't know'  
    - Strong opinions, loosely held 
    - Live with a feedback loop: reflect on how you did something and then think about how it should have been done better so that can be done next time 
    - Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
    - Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
- Live a meaningful life: 
    - The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
    - Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it  
- After breakup message: I’m 27. There really is more than enough time to find someone and settle down, get married and have kids. And before that, enjoy your time being single. Focus on advancing your career, become this more social person, make new friends, pursue new hobbies and just generally really be more of an independent man with character who is happy with who he is. Someone who isn’t obsessed around getting a response from someone else. Someone who lets go of things he doesn’t control. Someone who leads by example. You cannot depend on a relationship for happiness because one way or another, things will mess up. So ALWAYS live an independent happy life - then if someone joins that life, all the better. Just do not change for anything or anyone
