## Doing hard things
- It's important to do hard things that stretch me as they are great opportunities to learn and improve. Seek this challenge continiously. Get critical feedback to improve further
- Think about the bigger picture. Always believe the current strugles are small compared to where you want to go. 
- Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state
- Treat hard things as learning experiences. Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. You approached the experience in a certain way. Then you evaluate how it went and you can be better next time 
- Evaluate how others do it and try to emulate this 
- Prepare well in advance 
- Visualize doing it succesfully in the way you'd idealize it. 
- Use affirmations to convince yourself that you can do it 
- Bring it back to the person you want to be and realize that is just another step to getting there. 
- Depending on the situation:
    - Be grateful for the opportunity
    - Realize it needs to be done and there is no other option 
- Realize that it matters now, not in the future
- This too, shall pass. I had many struggles before and it all turned out fine. 
- Think about the situation in the grand scheme of things: 
  - Most things don't matter
  - What is the worst that could happen

On the day of execution: 
- Stay focused on other goals before the moment
- Realize is it okay and natural to be nervous
- Just before presentation: 
    - Find a way to relax – e.g. listen to music beforehand 
    - Power pose in a bathroom and make yourself as big possible 
    - Heavy breathing for a short while

## Happiness and purpose
Happiness is a state of fullfilment and calm mind. It's the absence of anxiety and fear and a general feeling of satisfaction - all of this can be obtained by training the mind. One could say that this is contentment and happiness is a general feeling which is harder to achieve sustainably. Be content and whenever you feel happy that's just a bonus. Whenever you experience joy, reflect on it - why did you feel it? Can you do more of it?

To achieve this state of calm, it's important to throw away any expectations or grand goals you may have. 
Striving for the end goal and doing the right thing in the process will distress tranquility. All that matters is here and now. 
Meaning to life is personal and the key is to be happy in the moment 
We seem happiest when we’re socialising with other people, outside or doing something that seems meaningful to us such as excercising and volunteering

Techniques for happiness: 
- Mindfullness
- Expressing your feelings (with others, in therapy, in a journal, through art). Focus on the things you're grateful for
- Enjoying the little things in life 
- Having a balance in the six fundamentals in life 

## General 
- Build character and get a thicker skin: 
    - Get uncomfortable more often
    - Seek out criticism
- Spend time with great people 
    - You are the average of the five people you spend most time with
    - Visualize how others would handle situations and emulate these situations (Naval, Paul G, Jocko)
- Become more well rounded (practice curiosity in a great many fields). 
    - Find and watch interesting documentaries and films: Reddit and Google for inspiration. Get to know the actors/producers better
    - Explore more music: Spotify playlists, Reddit, forums. Get to know and remember the artists better
    - Read fiction, short stories, poetry
    - Learn about lots of different topics: psychology, design, biology, history
    - Watch and learn more about people I admire - watch them present / read their interviews etc.  
    - Work on projects 
    - Pick up calming hobbies: puzzles, video games, colouring books, play an instrument, chess 
    - Dive into Wikipedia
    - Practice Martial Arts
    - Practice arts: colouring, sketching
    - Take walks in inspirational places (museums, nature, new cities)
    - Imagine being a role model for others and they look up to what I say. Be a great speaker, writer, be well rounded as they'll ask a wide range of different interesting questions and have opinions whilst being calm and confident
- What life is about:
    - Becoming better at things (and just becoming a better person): in life, try to become good at things you enjoy doing and be experimental. Six month sprints to try to become good at e.g. dancing, boxing, chess, badminton - this will slow time. Same for personal projects. Get better at things by caring a lot and focusing on constantly getting better
    - Being calm, in the moment and enjoying the little things in life 
    - We don't know what tomorrow will bring which is exciting. And then we'll always aim to make today better than yesterday and face the days with great enthusiasm. 
    - Creating lasting memories with people we love 
    - Family, friends, love, experiences, health, career and other than those, it's the little things: sex, hugs, nice drinks, good food, good books / films, good workouts
- Be experimental in life: try things and test if they improve my quality of life  
- Think bigger picture: it’s not about where you are currently; it is about where you are going. By focusing on the bigger picture, you realize your current problem is tiny in the grand scheme of things
- Even when you are doing everything well and have achieved great things, you may still be lost. If that is the case, go from doing things for yourself to helping others. This is where real fulfillment lies 
- Be able to switch mindset and focus depending on the surrounding. I.e. never taking my shit to places where it shouldn’t be – collect your headaches and shift the right gears

## To live by: 
- What's important in life: 
    - At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
    - What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
    - You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
    - There is no such thing as enough achievement to then say 'I am now ready to live'. Keep busy with anything other than the fundamental parts of living a good life is just procrastion to living that later will cause regret. 
- Life is short: 
    - You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
    - Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway
    - The days are long but the decades are short 
    - Life passes most people by while they’re making plans for it
    - Work to live, don’t live to work.
    - Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years
- You and you alone are responsible:     
    - No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
    - Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
    - Life is hard and will throw you many challenges. You survive them, learn from them and move on. You build character comprised of everything that happened in your life. Anything that happens should be seen as a lesson you can use to become better. 
- Relationships are incredibly important
    - Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
    - Be someone others would like to be around with
- Become a better version of yourself 
    - Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
    - See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
    - Learn to operate within your circle of competence. What is crucial is the you understand the boundaries of that circle and the size of the circle is irrelevant. Honestly define what you know and then stick to those areas. If you're outside, say 'I don't know'  
    - Strong opinions, loosely held 
    - Live with a feedback loop: reflect on how you did something and then think about how it should have been done better so that can be done next time 
    - Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
    - Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
- Live a meaningful life: 
    - The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
    - Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it  
- After breakup message: I’m 27. There really is more than enough time to find someone and settle down, get married and have kids. And before that, enjoy your time being single. Focus on advancing your career, become this more social person, make new friends, pursue new hobbies and just generally really be more of an independent man with character who is happy with who he is. Someone who isn’t obsessed around getting a response from someone else. Someone who lets go of things he doesn’t control. Someone who leads by example. You cannot depend on a relationship for happiness because one way or another, things will mess up. So ALWAYS live an independent happy life - then if someone joins that life, all the better. Just do not change for anything or anyone

Other
- Define who I am and what I want out of life. Translate these things to goals and get after them 
- We can choose to be the happiest person alive. It's literally just a choice once basics are accounted for 
- It's hard to be in the top 1% of things. Instead, be in the top 25% of three different things and you'll end up in a good space
- The growth mindset: love faillure and the challenge that comes with trying to figure out how to solve things - the harder it gets the harder we need to try and the whole process can become very informative. Understand that the world is full of interesting challenges that could help you learn and grow. 
- Always have an opinion on things. What did I think of this meal? Of this film? Why do I think this - what makes it such and how does it compare to other things?
