## Important elements of life 
There are 7 things that matter most in my life: family, love, friends, health, career, experiences, personal goals & hobbies. It is important these are all in balance and that you have a vision for them. With this vision, it's easy to figure out what you should be spending your time on. By thinking about what really matters, you can stop chasing that which doesn’t really matter and start living a much fuller life 

And any big decision within these areas is very influential to my life so spend a lot of time thinking about them (where you love, who you're with and what you do). If you can't decide, the answer is no. If you need a spreadsheet to list pros and cons, forget about it - don't do it. The hardest thing is not doing what you want—it’s knowing what you want.

You want to be able to seperate from your mind and look at yourself objectively. Most people are trapped in their own heads. 
The end goal is to live a simple life. 
The default state should be: this is great – let’s make the most of the situation at hand

Have a personal philosophy and then live by it. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life.
- Who you want to be (character and values) 
- What you want to achieve and contribute

### Family
- Always be there for the family and be responsible
- Show that you care
- Appreciate them 
- Do fun things

### Love
- Be the best partner I can be 
- Always be present - separate work stress from private time
- Show that you care 
- Do fun things and take initiative here  
- Communicate feelings 

### Friends
- Meet at least 1 friend a week 
- Make a commitment to stay in touch with friends globally 
- Be interested and meet new people. Everybody could be a potential great friend 
- Add value to the lives of others
- Be nice to strangers

### Health
- Physical activity: Extremely fit: flexible, strong endurance, speed and strength
- Heathy diet: Eat healthy and drinks lots of water. Take supplements and eat lots of fruits and veg. Cook meals fresh as much as possible  
- Get good quality sleep
- Take care of appearance/body/skin and hygiene 
- Good ergonomic posture and general confident body language 

### Mental 
- Being in the present moment through mindfulness and meditation 
- In touch with my feelings through CBT, journalling and reflection
- Mind development through reading, curiosity 

### Career
- Act as if I'm Head of BI: have the confidence and take the ownership that comes with the role
- Regularly reflect on the development goals and make sure I'm on top of it. 
- Be enthusiastic and energetic around creating impact
- Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism - be confident we can figure things out 
- Be resourceful, solution oriented and curious
- Build meaningful relationships 
- Be social. Be enthusiastic, show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me. Take the initiative and just speak to people - absolutely nothing to lose

### Experiences 
- Travel
- Fulfil bucket list 
- Do things that create lasting memories
- Get many 'highs' in your life and be in the moment to fully appreciate them 
- Experience and explore more 

### Personal goals & hobbies 
- Set goals and work towards them for extended periods of time. Make your life a book with chapters worth reading 
- Have hobbies that you enjoy doing - this will make me a confident and interesting person. To find those hobbies, pick up something (anything), do it for an extended amount of time, try to become better at it and see how it sticks - more than anything, be curious around the thing you're learning/doing
- Do things for the sake of doing them only - just because you want to. There is no goal, there is no real reason - you just want to do it. They're no checklists to tick off. The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way, the more present you are and the happier you’ll feel 
- Have bigger things going on for you beyond work: have hobbies, work out, work towards achieving goals. 
- When feeling unproductive, realize why you're doing this: wanting to become a more well rounded person. Be relaxed and in the moment. 
- Don't keep busy for the sake of being busy - that's a very narrow life. Instead, try to purposefully be imperfect. Read that book that you don't follow. Watch a bad movie. Do something you would usually consider not worth doing and stick to it.  
- Do small things and enjoy them. Be mindful when watering the plants, think about the food when cooking. Enjoy the environment when walking outside. And then celebrate what you have achieved. 
- To foster passion:
  - What do I like to think about?
  - Where does my mind wander?
  - What do I really care about?
  - What matters most to me?
  - How do I enjoy spending my time?
  - What did I enjoy when I was younger? 
- Hobbies that work well for me: Where I enjoy the process. I.e. not just liking the idea of being good at something, but visualizing that I'll also enjoy the process. 
- A main part in my belief system is that of balance. It’s not about doing something 100% and only ever doing that. It’s about making time for many different things
- Bring my strenths to activites. I tend to learn and analyze. E.g. bring skills to fiction. Learn character development, understand the language and the building of sentences.

## The pyramid to achieving the right things
- Personal manisfesto: what's most important in my life? Who you are, what you stand for, what you want out of life?
- (Vision: where do I want the year to go?)
- Goals: what projects are required to reach the vision?
- Projects: tracking the things I'm working on?
- Habits: what do I do on a daily basis to get me closer to where I want to be?

## My ideal being   
With these principles, think hard about them, implement them, make mistakes and reiterate them after thoughtful reflection 
- Happy 
- Confident
- Calm 
- Patient
- Positive (no complaining)
- High energy 
- Enthusiastic
- Honest

## Reduce worry 
- Focus on other things 
  - Get busy doing other things - this allows you no time to worry 
  - Focus on caring about other people - your worries will reduce in magnitude. 
  - Think about how you can please someone and do that
  - Write your worries down on paper - then put the paper away. Come back to it two weeks later. If it still worries you, put it back again for another two weeks. Most of the time, that worry will solve itself. Either the problem solved itself or our mental attitude changed so it no longer has power to trouble us.  
- Be realistic 
  - Why don't you stop right now and ask yourself: "What in the hell am I worrying about?" You will probably find that it is comparatively unimportant and insignificant.
  - 99% of the things we worry about don't happen 
  - Read history - things were way worse in the past - our current situation isn't all that bad. 
  - Put your situation in the grand scheme of things. 
  - Don't take yourself or your situation so seriously - if I were to die now, the world would go on just fine without me. 
  - Will this matter two months from now? If not, don't worry about it. 
- Relax
  - Relax your body language when working 
- Become tougher 
  - Have experienced hardship or even rock bottom. Everything we experience is small in comparison. 
- Force happiness 
  - You can't worry when you're laughing at yourself at the same time.
- Accept
  - Co­operate with the inevitable. If you know a circumstance is beyond your power to change or revise, say to yourself "It is so; it cannot be otherwise."
- Three steps
  - What am I worrying about? What is the problem?
  - What is the cause of it? 
  - What can I do about it? (if nothing, forget about it - ride the wave - be aware and curious. If it has to be, it has to be) Think about multiple possible solutions 
  - Pick the best solution

## Awareness
We’re wired to believe we need money, status etc. This makes us chase these things and in the pursuit of it, we forget to appreciate what we already have. The tragic thing is we give up on living because we chase something that is different from what we have right now. Everything we need, we already have it up for taking. We seldom think of what we have but always of what we lack. So rather than wanting more, focus on appreciating what we already have and the here and now - we have a lot to be thankful for. 

It is difficult to be in touch with this reality because once we do, we don't know what we find. We think life should be lived in a certain way because that's how we've done it. We'd lose control of the things we think we value so much and we thought were so important. So instead of facing this, we distract ourselves with tv and social media and other mindless activity. 

How to achieve awareness
-	Awareness is not a goal to achieve. With awareness, there’s nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. To experience every moment – we don’t “want” this – we do or we don’t. 
-	Observe yourself – be aware of your behaviour. Reflect on your behaviour – were you aware or did you get carried away? By understanding, we can change. Everything that happens to us, see it as if it were happening to someone else – no judgement, no attempt to change – only to understand. 
-	Don’t stop desiring, but see the desire for what it is and understand it. Desire then turns into preference. 
-	Every negative feeling is an opportunity to be aware – to observe it from the outside. It won’t go away but as you understand it, it will happen less frequently. 
-	When we have certain thoughts (for example distorted) or we’re hard on ourselves – just be aware of it. Don’t try to change it – observe it as if it were happening to someone else 
-	Learn what it means to experience each moment fully, then drop it and move on to the next moment, uninfluenced by the previous one. 
- Understand that society is made up and all we have is our body, thoughts and surroundings where we can find hapiness. Beyond that, we're just a bunch of monkeys. 

## Identity
-	We are not our thoughts – they come and they go. Anxiety comes and goes
-	Our identity is a combination of past experiences, conditioning and programming 
-	In life, you want to observe yourself – do you identify with your behaviour or are you aware of your behaviour? 
-	There is no need to change anything to be happy, we already have it in us, we just don’t experience it. We need to drop illusions, ambitions, greed, cravings. And these all come from having identified with labels. 

What we identify with is always changing. "I am a success", "I am a businessman". That’s not true – these things come and go and can change. By identifying with them, we cling to them. We’re worried that they fall apart and that’s why we suffer. We fear mistakes, we start to depend on others and lose our freedom and we constantly need to live to up expectations. 

Our perception is clouded by the need to get our drugs and that’s what we see things and people for – we stop seeing things as they are and respond accurately. 

We can combat this by developing a taste for the good things in life. Loving your work for the sake of actually loving it – not to get somewhere. Laughter and intimacy with people we don’t cling to or depend on but whose company we enjoy. Doing things we love such that any outcome is irrelevant – reading a good book or watching a good movie. Retrieve to nature. When we don’t identify, criticism and flattery becomes less daunting. It's based on the other persons concepts of what they think I am and their mood, their outlook of life at the point in time. The actual I is always changing, like the universe is always changing. We stop being hurt or not liked; we no longer have the need to impress everyone. 

This comes from an approach where we are happy to be nobody – success or failure become irrelevant. Making a fool of ourselves – what does it matter?! By not having something to live towards, we lose our tension about succeeding and our fear of failure – you will be yourself and relaxed. This comes from a feeling that we’re good enough as we are. 

## Happiness and purpose
### What is happiness? 
Contentment is a state of fullfilment. It's the absence of anxiety, fear and desires and it's about being present and not stuck in your own head. Happiness is contentment in motion - when something happens you really enjoy. Sitting by yourself is not happiness, it's contentment. 

You can then accept the current state of things and he more present we are, the happier we’ll be. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something. In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence and really embrace the present moment and the reality of what is then you are content, and you are happy.

### How to achieve happiness
- Realize its a choice and we can prioritize it above everything else. It’s about finding things we do that gives us internal peace/contentment and we need to trial with these things until we find something that works for us and just making a commitment to ourselves to be a happier person.  
- To achieve this contentment, throw away any expectations or grand goals you may have. Each goal will lead to another and misses the point of being present.
- Believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self. Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You’re just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute. Every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way. Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work.
- Be more grateful: “Stop asking why and start saying wow.” The world is such an amazing place. As humans, we’re used to taking everything for granted. 
- Find happiness in acceptance. Rather than striving for something or wanting to solve problems, get peace on the inside by accepting the ways things just are. What can help with this: 
  - Embrace death. It's coming and you can't run from it. More generally, let go of what you can't control
  - It’s okay whatever the outcome is. 
  - We don’t always get what we want, but sometimes what is happening is for the best. The sooner you can accept it as a reality, the sooner you can adapt to it.
  - To accept: step back and look at previous bits of suffering I’ve had in my life. Write them down and ask what happened? 
- Can you imagine a man who goes around shaking hands with porters and expressing sympathy for the cooks in the hot kitchen and telling people how much he admires their dogs, can you imagine a man like that being sour and worried and needing the services of a psychiatrist? You can't, can you? No, of course not
- 

Practical techniques for happiness: 
- Mindfullness: meditation, yoga, hobbies that create a state of relaxation 
- Expressing your feelings (with others, in therapy, in a journal, through art)
- Spending time with happy people
- Read great books 
- Physically alternations: sit up and act as if cheerfullness is already there. Smile.  
- Get more sunlight 
- Working out 
- Reduce screen and social media time
- It’s the news’ job to make you anxious and angry. But its underlying scientific, economic, education, and conflict trends are positive. Stay optimistic. 
- Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody or being annoyed by something, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?" Even if you can’t come up with something positive, you can say, “Well, the Universe is going to teach me something now. Now I get to listen and learn.”
- Making other people happy is probably a great way to guarantee personal happiness also. Help other get ahead first. Give and add value and don’t want/expect anything in return 
- Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day. 
- A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest? 
- Remove any should from your life. Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate them

## Meaning of life 
Meaning to life is personal and the key is to be happy in the moment. I don’t think there is any end goal or purpose. I’m just living life as I want to. I’m literally just doing it moment to moment.

Answer 2: There is no meaning to life. The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the Universe, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the next 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe. Anything you do will fade. It will disappear. Life has no meaning as a meaning is a formula that makes sense to the mind – life is a mystery that makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind. 

We seem happiest when we’re socialising with other people, outside or doing something that seems meaningful to us such as excercising and volunteering (effective altruism, focus on wife/kids, solve problems to better the world and make life better for others, perform and learn about arts, study philosophy and spirituality, get to know your inner psyche). Sometimes meaning of life comes from things are inherently worthless. Learn an instrument, buy a motorcycle, make a painting, become a scuba instructor, run a marathon, try drugs, move to another country, sit at a park/cafe and talk with people. Spice up and really experience life.

Life is like a piece of music. The "point" of listening to it lies in the listening - not the getting to the end of the track. If you build and optimize your life around "getting to the end" - whatever that has meant for you, getting a degree, reaching a certain amount of wealth, a certain amount of success, a certain kind of partner, etc. - you will eventually find that there is no more "end" to get to. Well, the way out of this is really stupid - you just have to learn to enjoy the music instead of always looking forward to reaching the end of the track.

The goals we should strive for are those that have no endpoint, just continuous honing of a craft. Fatherhood is an example - there’s no “endpoint” - you find meaning from being an ever greater father.

## General 
- Build character and get a thicker skin: 
    - Hardship and setbacks are a part of life. We need to deal with and accept this reality. Not everything is about roses and moonshine. We need to deal with the cards we’re given. We need to go on and not be stuck in the past. Learn to absorb the shocks along the rocky roads of life. 
    - Character is having gone through hard times and coming out on top
    - Get uncomfortable more often
    - Seek out criticism
    - You always want to see the reality, the way things are. This is hard because we have preconceived notions around how things should be. When something bad happens, we then suffer because we’ve been putting off reality – we’ve been hiding it from ourselves. The moment of suffering then is a moment of truth. It is a moment where you’re forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. -	The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality (.e.g advising a friend of a breakup being in it yourself)
    - Choose short term pain in order to get longer term happiness 
    - When there’s pain, it means there is something to learn. The more you deal and face the pain, the more you learn and the better you become at encountering similar or even heavier pains. 
    - Think of life as a puzzle: every challenge you solve is a principle that helps avoid the same sort of problem in the future
    - Pain + reflection = Progress
    - Criticism: 
      - Realize we're not perfect so we're often wrong. When there is criticism - maybe you deserve it. Be thanful and work with it. 
    - Act as if we are confident and got everything sorted. 
- Spend time with great people 
    - You are the average of the five people you spend most time with
    - Visualize how others would handle situations and emulate these situations (Naval, Paul G, Jocko)
- Become more well rounded (practice curiosity in a great many fields). 
    - Find and watch interesting documentaries and films: Reddit and Google for inspiration. Get to know the actors/producers better
    - Explore more music: Spotify playlists, Reddit, forums. Get to know and remember the artists better
    - Read fiction, short stories, poetry and generally just a lot of different topics. 
    - Learn about lots of different topics: psychology, design, biology, history, micro economics, persuasion, mathematics, science, game theory
    - Watch and learn more about people I admire - watch them present / read their interviews etc.  
    - Work on projects 
    - Pick up calming hobbies: puzzles, video games, colouring books, play an instrument, chess 
    - Dive into Wikipedia
    - Practice Martial Arts
    - Practice creativity/arts: colouring, sketching, play an instrument, sing, dance
    - Take walks in inspirational places (museums, nature, new cities)
    - Imagine being a role model for others and they look up to what I say. Be a great speaker, writer, be well rounded as they'll ask a wide range of different interesting questions and have opinions whilst being calm and confident. Foster these opinions can reflecting how I feel about things: What did I think of this meal? Of this film? Why do I think this - what makes it such and how does it compare to other things? 
    - Take at least one day a week where you just have time to think. It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. 
- What life is about:
    - Becoming better at things (and just becoming a better person): in life, try to become good at things you enjoy doing and be experimental. Six month sprints to try to become good at e.g. dancing, boxing, chess, badminton - this will slow time. Same for personal projects. Get better at things by caring a lot and focusing on constantly getting better
    - Being calm, in the moment and enjoying the little things in life 
    - We don't know what tomorrow will bring which is exciting. And then we'll always aim to make today better than yesterday and face the days with great enthusiasm. 
    - Creating lasting memories with people we love 
    - Family, friends, love, experiences, health, career and other than those, it's the little things: sex, hugs, nice drinks, good food, good books / films, good workouts
    - "Life is not a problem to solve but a reality to experiencence"
- Be experimental in life: try things and test if they improve my quality of life  
- Think bigger picture: it’s not about where you are currently; it is about where you are going. By focusing on the bigger picture, you realize your current problem is tiny in the grand scheme of things
- Even when you are doing everything well and have achieved great things, you may still be lost. If that is the case, go from doing things for yourself to helping others. This is where real fulfillment lies 
- Be able to switch mindset and focus depending on the surrounding. I.e. never taking my shit to places where it shouldn’t be – collect your headaches and shift the right gears
- Don’t assume things, just go with the flow instead. Don’t overthink and don't try to control everything. Instead, open your heart and see what happens - allow yourself to be vulnerable. 
- Just tell yourself: it’s okay. I’ve got this. All will be well. 
- We want freedom. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don’t want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. Once you can solve your money problems, either by lowering your lifestyle or by making enough money, you want to retire. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.
- In every situation, no matter how bad it is, ask yourself: in which way can I turn this around to make it positive for me? Or: why is this a good thing? Interpret everything as positively for yourself. Remember that the brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality 
- Sometimes there are uncomfortable situations and you just need to delve into them. E.g. at an airplane with babies shouting in both ears. Really feel the emotions and study them objectively. You will quickly get used to being in discomfort. Get out of your comfort zone
- Each day is day one and each breath is a new arrival

## To live by: 
- What's important in life: 
    - At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
    - What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
    - You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
    - There is no such thing as enough achievement to then say 'I am now ready to live'. Keep busy with anything other than the fundamental parts of living a good life is just procrastion to living that later will cause regret. 
    - Be grateful if the body and what we can do with it because one day well no longer be able to
    - Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up
    - A life wisely lived has many good habits maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured 
- Life is short: 
    - You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
    - Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway and I'm really not the centre of the universe
    - The days are long but the decades are short 
    - Life passes most people by while they’re making plans for it
    - Work to live, don’t live to work.
    - Most people over-estimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years
    - It's a mirable that we're alive in the first place 
    - Each day is a new start. Each breath is a new start to become the person you want to be
    - Every hour more in your life is but a privilege so make the very best of it, for time is limited in our lives. Threat time with others as possibly the last time you have with them. We will all be gone soon and so will the ones we love the most. 
    - Simply realize that none of this ultimately matters at all. Once you realize that, you can see through the game and relax. 
    - The best armour against old age is a life well spend preceding it
- You and you alone are responsible:     
    - No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
    - Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
    - Life is hard and will throw you many challenges. You survive them, learn from them and move on. You build character comprised of everything that happened in your life. Anything that happens should be seen as a lesson you can use to become better. 
    - We have the ability to choose how we respond to everything. It’s not what happens to us that hurts us, but our response that hurts us 
    - Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life
    - Don’t worry about whether you like your current situation or not. Life doesn’t care about what you do and don’t like. It’s up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do and then power that all the way through. 
    - See yourself as a machine – there is a worker in the machine and there is a designer of the machine. It’s much more important to be a good designer/manager of your life than being a worker in it. E.g. the designer needs to identify the workers strengths and weaknesses and adjust accordingly either by working on the weaknesses (best option but only if fixing the weakness is within your nature), or working around them(e.g. hiring others). It is naïve to think you can do most things perfectly or even very well  
- Relationships are incredibly important
    - Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
    - Be someone others would like to be around with
    - Family and loved ones will at some point die. Make very sure you did what you could do at any point to show that you love and care for them
- Become a better version of yourself 
    - Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
    - See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
    - Learn to operate within your circle of competence. What is crucial is the you understand the boundaries of that circle and the size of the circle is irrelevant. Honestly define what you know and then stick to those areas. If you're outside, say 'I don't know'  
    - Strong opinions, loosely held 
    - Live with a feedback loop: reflect on how you did something and then think about how it should have been done better so that can be done next time 
    - Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
    - Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
    - “All I want to know is where I am going to die, so I’ll never go there”
    - “Never fool yourself and remember you’re the easiest person to fool”
- Live a meaningful life: 
    - The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
    - Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it  
    - Don't expect much so there is little disappointment. What you desire most ends up owing you
    - “If you’re like me – it’s kind of fun for life to be complicated. I think you’ll just have to endure the world – as complicated as it is” 
    - The best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence, all your enthusiasm, on doing today's work superbly today. That is the only possible way you can prepare for the future.
- After breakup message: I’m 27. There really is more than enough time to find someone and settle down, get married and have kids. And before that, enjoy your time being single. Focus on advancing your career, become this more social person, make new friends, pursue new hobbies and just generally really be more of an independent man with character who is happy with who he is. Someone who isn’t obsessed around getting a response from someone else. Someone who lets go of things he doesn’t control. Someone who leads by example. You cannot depend on a relationship for happiness because one way or another, things will mess up. So ALWAYS live an independent happy life - then if someone joins that life, all the better. Just do not change for anything or anyone

## Life experiment framework
- Observations—What are you observing in your life or business that you want to improve?
- Knowns—What have you learned from past Experiments that might be related to your observations?
- Hypotheses—Based on what you’ve observed, what situations or factors might cause or contribute to your observations?
- Tests—What will you try or change to improve your situation? Which hypotheses will this experiment Test?
