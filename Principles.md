## Doing hard things
- It's important to do hard things that stretch me as they are great opportunities to learn and improve. Seek this challenge continiously. Get critical feedback to improve further
- Think about the bigger picture. Always believe the current strugles are small compared to where you want to go. 
- Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state
- Treat hard things as learning experiences. Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. You approached the experience in a certain way. Then you evaluate how it went and you can be better next time 
- Evaluate how others do it and try to emulate this 
- Prepare well in advance 
- Visualize doing it succesfully in the way you'd idealize it. 
- Bring it back to the person you want to be and realize that is just another step to getting there. 
- Depending on the situation:
    - Be grateful for the opportunity
    - Realize it needs to be done and there is no other option 
- Realize that it matters now, not in the future
- This too, shall pass. I had many struggles before and it all turned out fine. 

On the day of execution: 
- Stay focused on other goals before the moment
- Realize is it okay and natural to be nervous
- Just before presentation: 
    - Find a way to relax – e.g. listen to music beforehand 
    - Power pose in a bathroom and make yourself as big possible 
    - Heavy breathing for a short while


## General 
- Build character and get a thicker skin: 
    - Get uncomfortable more often
    - Seek out criticism
- Spend time with great people 
    - You are the average of the five people you spend most time with
    - Visualize how others would handle situations and emulate these situations (Naval, Paul G, Jocko)
- Be more curious in day to day: let your mind wonder and explore. Read more wikipedian, fiction and watch more docus      
- What life is about:
    - Becoming better at things: in life, try to become good at things you enjoy doing and be experimental. Six month sprints to try to become good at e.g. dancing, boxing, chess, badminton - this will slow time. Same for personal projects
    - Being calm, in the moment and enjoying the little things in life 
    - We don't know what tomorrow will bring which is exciting. And then we'll always aim to make today better than yesterday and face the days with great enthusiasm. 
    - Creating lasting memories with people we love 
    - Family, friends, love, experiences, health, career and other than those, it's the little things: sex, hugs, nice drinks, good food, good books / films, good workouts
- Be experimental in life: try things and test if they improve my quality of life  
- Think bigger picture: it’s not about where you are currently; it is about where you are going. By focusing on the bigger picture, you realize your current problem is tiny in the grand scheme of things

## To live by: 
- What's important in life: 
    - At some point, life will flash you by. Make sure it is worth watching. 
    - What do you want people to say at your funeral? And who would be there even?
    - You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
- Life is short: 
    - You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
    - Life is a test and a game – don’t take things too seriously and have fun - nobody gets out alive anyway
    - The days are long but the decades are short 
    - Life passes most people by while they’re making plans for it
    - Work to live, don’t live to work.
- You and you alone are responsible:     
    - No one owes you anything and nobody gives a fuck about your feelings 
    - Own your life, no one else will. You are responsible for how you handle everything that happens to you. You just pick yourself up, learn and go on. 
- Relationships are incredibly important
    - Treat everyone like they can put you on the front page on the New York Times 
    - Be someone others would like to be around with
- Become a better version of yourself 
    - Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow 
    - See who you can become and how far you can go – become the very best version of yourself
    - Learn to operate within your circle of competence. What is crucial is the you understand the boundaries of that circle and the size of the circle is irrelevant. Honestly define what you know and then stick to those areas. If you're outside, say 'I don't know'  
    - Strong opinions, loosely held 
    - Live with a feedback loop: reflect on how you did something and then think about how it should have been done better so that can be done next time 
    - Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
    - Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
- Live a meaningful life: 
    - The person who is satisfied with little will always have enough
    - Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But you just make the most of it
