# Plants

## Maintenance 
### Maintenance general
- Check how you're plants are doing on a daily basis - the more love they get, the healthier they'll be 
- Maintain each plant seperately - don't water on a schedule as different plant have different needs

### Watering
- Water the plants in the mornings such that they are dry by the evenings 
- Ideally, use filtered water rather than hard water
- Water a plant and then ensure no more water drips from the drainage holes before placing the plant back in the decorative pot 
- Use room temperature water to avoid a temperature shock for the plant
- When you can't water a plant from the top, put the plant in a plate of water and let the roots suck the water up
- When you can't touch the soil, go by the weight of the plant to identify whether it needs watering
- Plants need less water in the winter
- Remove old brown leaves

### Maintenance by plant 
*Devils Ivy*
- Not fussy about light 
- Light watering when the soil has dried out 
- Occasional misting
- Repot in spring 
- Fertilize monthly in growth season 

*Boston fern*
- Loves humidity - mist her a few times a week
- Loves being moist - water when the top inch feels fry. Let excess water drain. Never allow the soil to get dry
- Ideal for a room with limited light 
- Don’t touch her much as she’ll turn brown 
- Fertilize once a month during growth season 

*Dragon tree*
- Low maintenance on water - stick a finger in the soil and if dry, give it some water
- Mist every few days
- Happy to be in most light conditions, just not harsh raw sunlight
- Fertilize once every 3 months during growth season 

*Cactus*
- They prefer sun
- Only water when the soil is completely dry
- Don't allow the plant to stay wet 
- Fertilize once every 3 months in growth season 

*Succulents*
- Water sparingly - only when entirely dried out. When watering, give them loads as they'll then quickly dry out again. When it's hard to water because of the shape of the plant, pot in a pot of water instead. 
- They want lots of light - full sunlight is also just fine
- Turn the plants regularly such that each side gets a similar amount of sunlight
- Fertilize once every 3 months in growth season 

*ZZ plant*
- Light room outside of direct sunlight 
- Needs little watering - the soil needs to be just moist and the top 5 cm should be dry between waterings
- Feed once a month from spring to late summer
- Dust the leaves to allow sunlight in

*Heart of Jesus*
- Indirect sunlight 
- Watering each week or when the top 3 cm has dried out. Water until the soil is fully saturated 
- Fertilize once a month during growth season

*Elephants Ears*
- Partial sunlight to full shade
- Watering each week or when the top 3 cm has dried out. Water until the soil is fully saturated 

*Rubber plant*
- Full to partial sun
- Average water needs when top 3 cm has dried out 
- Fertilize once a month during growth season

## Potting 
- When receiving a plant, let it get climatized
- After a few weeks, check the roots
- When to repot: 
  - When the roots are coming out of the existing soil 
- How to report: 
  - Take as much soil away without damaging the roots 
  - Big plants: replace the top layer of the soil (5-10cm) 
  - Raplace with the soil mixture that works best for the specific plant 
  - Aim to report in spring/summer
  - Replace the pot with a slightly larger pot (+5cm) 
- Do not plant directly in a pot without a drainage hole. So if I buy e.g. succulents, either pot in a pot with hole + saucer or keep it in its nursery pot within the decoration pot 
- In baskets, put a plastic saucer to avoid mess
- Sometimes we might need to increase height in decorative pot - pebbles are good for this as they are also a drainage solution

## Signs that maintenance is required
- When the first 1-2 cm of the soil is dry, it's time to water
- Brown leaf tips means it's time to mist the plant
- If underwatered: put in pot of water for 30 minutes
- If overwatered: remove pot and surround the plant with paper towels 

## Plant feeding
- Feed a few weeks after plant is home
- Feed a few months after the plant is repotted
- In spring / summer
  - Add liquid food to water once a month. Feed when the plant is already moist to avoid nutrition to drain away 
- Don't feed plants in the winter

## Plant cleaning
- Dust leaves with a damp cloth
- Palms can be under a shower to get rid of dust
