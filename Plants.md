# Plants

## Maintenance 
### Maintenance general
- Maintain each plant seperately - don't water on a schedule as different plant have different needs
- Water a plant and then ensure no more water drips from the drainage holes before placing the plant back in the decorative pot 
- Check how you're plants are doing on a daily basis 

### Maintenance by plant 
*Devils Ivy*
- Not fussy about light 
- Light watering when the soil has dried out 
- Occasional misting

*Boston fern*
- Loves humidity - mist her a few times a week
- Loves being moist - water when the top inch feels fry. Let excess water drain. Never allow the soil to get dry
- Ideal for a room with limited light 
- Don’t touch her much as she’ll turn brown 

*Dragon tree*
- Low maintenance on water - stick a finger in the soil and if dry, give it some water
- Mist every few days
- Happy to be in most light conditions, just not harsh raw sunlight

*Cactus*
- They prefer sun
- Only water when the soil is completely dry
- Don't allow the plant to stay wet 

## Potting 
- When receiving a plant, let it get climatized
- After a few weeks, check the roots
- When to repot: 
  - When the roots are coming out of the existing soil 
- How to report: 
  - Take as much soil away without damaging the roots 
  - Big plants: replace the top layer of the soil
  - Raplace with the soil mixture that works best for the specific plant 
- Do not plant directly in a pot without a drainage hole. So if I buy e.g. succulents, either pot in a pot with hole + saucer or keep it in its nursery pot within the decoration pot 
- In baskets, put a plastic saucer to avoid mess
- Sometimes we might need to increase height in decorative pot - pebbles are good for this as they are also a drainage solution
