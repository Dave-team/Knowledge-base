# Negotiation

## Principles
- Look for win-win decisions. 
- If you don't like the agreement, simply back off. 'We’d love to do business with you but this deal is just not for us. Let’s get together on something else later'
- Give and take: we reciprociate each other. Try to get what matters most and give what matters least 
- Never take on any problems and transfer as many problems as possible to their side
- Always ask for more than you expect - you can always lower afterwards 
- Never agree with a first offer / never say yes the first time around
- When asked for a concession, always ask for something in return
- Play good cop bad cop – someone really excited and then someone who is really struggling with the pricing 
- Show that you are willing to eat shit to get to the right price and conditions – be very critical and demanding 
- Generally, AE’s can give up to 40% discount. Any higher discounts would need to be approved by those above the AE’s
- Hold ground as long as possible 
- Make sure you’re talking to the right person around the table 
- Always double check anything in writing, especially contracts. Often, it is not actually the same as what you both agreed upon 
- When someone says no: what about this doesn’t work for you? Or it seems like something is bothering you
- Always get everything in writing 
- If you don’t come to an agreement about something, set the issue aside and go on to another topic
- Always keep the north star in mind (what is it that we are really after) 
- When given a no, dig deeper for the why. what about this doesn’t work for you? Or it seems like something is bothering you
- Always understand pricing structure as this can be used to your advantage. 
- If you can’t negotiate on price, negotiate on something else: free period, different payment terms, etc. 
- Work in terms of percentage discounts. E.g. they give a quote below the list price. Figure out what percentage discount that this (e.g. 30%) and then set aims as to how much you’re willing to pay. In this case, aim for 40% discount so say the number that represents that percentage discount
- If you’re asking something of people, ask them for something ridiculous they wouldn’t say yes to. Then ask for something much smaller and they’ll be much more inclined to say yes 

## Process
Preparation
- Understand first what the other party wants. Put yourself in their shoes
- Establish a clear agenda prior to the meeting 
- Anticipate what questions might pop up 
- Know your goals and best, expected and worst outcome for the negotiation
- Establish a walk away point 
- Do your homework: benchmark prices vs competitors, know the prices competitors are getting, know what’s happening in the markets, understand their price structure and where there margins are at 
- Have a best alternative: if negotiations don’t go through, know that you have things left in the pipeline. This is your BATNA
- Always have multiple factors on the table to negotiate on. So not only price but e.g. online	delivery times

Meeting
- Establish common ground and interests
- Never assume you understand what the other side means – ask many questions to understand, even stupid questions 
- Ask for reasons why things are the way they are 
- Understand their pricing structure deeply which can help leverage down the line
- Lead communication and steer it into the direction you need it to go to. Don’t be afraid of cutting people short 
- Never directly believe what someone says: we cannot do this, we cannot give you this. Dig deeper here and find workarounds to get what you want. Don't be afraid to say that you don't believe them and dig deeper to understand where they get their numbers from 
- Don't believe any numbers thrown on the table - they will be overstated
- Show surprise when they mention e.g. their price, even when it doesn’t actually surprise you. This will help later on in the negotiation 

### Ways to negotiate
- Some arguments that might work: 
    - High growth 
    - Large volumes
    - Introductions to other businesses
    - Promise on SLA's
    - New 'logo' for their client base - perhaps a new industry or vertical for them
    - Promise to provide a case study
    - Ability to sign a longer term contract
    - Can sign quickly
- Practical tips:
    - Mention your total budget and that you need to fit in that budget for things to work
    - Negotiate deals at month end / quarter end to get good deals 
    - Clarify that you want to move quickly and any investments that are larger than X would require you to go to the board, which would be a slower process. Both parties want to sign the deal ASAP
- Benchmark: Is what they’re asking fair? Is this a usual price or are we actually paying more? If possible, benchmark 
- Ask if it’s possible to do something with the price AND PROVIDE CONTEXT AROUND WHY YOU’RE ASKING FOR A DISCOUNT. We’d want to create a story rather than a hard request. 

## Phrases to use
- “You have to do better than that”. Then, shut up
- “Why?”
- “How is that?”
- “Why not?”
- “So you are telling me that” 
- “I don’t believe that”
- “Let me check and I’ll come back to you on this matter”
- “How do you mean?”
- “Is there anything else”
- “What can you do with the price”
- “Is that your absolute best?”
- What is the difference between yourselves and X (cheaper priced alternative)
- What support do you offer
- What are some features/tools that your company is working on to stay ahead of the competition?
- Why did the last two clients cancel their contracts? Who are they using now? Can we call them?

## Papier Looker Contract
- Kick off the renewal process a few months before so there is enough time to review options and to not be surprised by a sudden increase in cost
- In the meeting, go through: 
  - Company / User growth 
  - What is happening to the price of the subscription / users? Why does it go up? Can we have it not go up? 
  - It’s hard to convince the CFO - is there anything we can do that could lead to a discount? Often, this can be signing up more users at once for example 
- Ask them to send some proposals over email and promise to look into it + speak with CFO 
- They send something over 
- Can we do X for the same discount instead? I might be able to negotiate for that with our CFO 
- Look at for: 
  - Renewal periods. Longer term often locks the pricing  so we avoid a price increase when it happens. 
  - Make sure that the pricing for the existing users stays flat - i.e. at least no increase 

## Fivetran contract 
- Credits no longer rolling over > incentivizing us to buy less > if we buy less, there won’t be as much economies of scale 
- We can map out our expected growth for the next year, calculating MAR by different months (e.g. accounting for peak period) 
- If we’d need to top up our credits, we’d be able to do so during the year (the price per credit would be fixed)

### Looker contract renewal
Hi Philip, 
 
Great meeting you last Friday and excited to see what’s ahead in the roadmap! 
 
Agreed that we’re slightly over our user licenses. We have had a lot of org changes recently which have caused this. Two questions around the proposed contract:
- We’re closer to having 35 users and in the past we've been able to add increments of 5 - can we increase our user licenses by 5 now, and then another 5 when we will move towards 40?
- I was wondering if there is more room to discount the new users? The wedding market (our core business) has been really challenged since COVID and we're trying to save wherever we can as a business. Would a monthly cost of $50 per user be possible?  
Thanks,
 
Dave

**Kickoff renewal process**
Hi Philip, 
 
I believe our current Looker contract ends on March 31. Could we kick-off the renewal process?
 
We are interested in continuing our partnership with Looker but want to have enough time to review other options in case we can't reach an agreement on renewal terms.
 
Cheers, 
Will

**Ask for discount**
Hi Joe, 
 
Was there supposed to be an attachment on this?  You mention to "take a look at the paperwork", but I don't see a link to any.
 
Groups of 20 are, unfortunately, out of reach for us right now.  I doubt we would hire 10 more users before the end of the year.  Could we get that same discount for a group of 10?  I might be able to negotiate Finance's approval for those accounts in advance for the renewal.
 
Cheers, 
Will


**Ask for CFO approval**
Hi Tony, 
 
Attached is the proposed new Looker contract as our current one expires March 31.  ~$55K (£40K) annual contract including additional accounts detailed below.
 
Looker has agreed not to do their typical 10% increase, mainly as an accommodation to businesses because of the ongoing pandemic.  I recommend we sign for another 2 years, this will lock in our existing pricing, but still give us the flexibility to transition to other tools in 2 years if there is a better offering.
 
Looker has also offered a 25% discount on 10 accounts if we buy them as part of the renewal.  I believe we should do this because:
- We will profit from this deal as long as we need to buy more accounts before June 1st (highly likely given the hiring plan)
- We are already over our 40 accounts (currently 42).
- Looker has honored historic pricing per account, so there is a chance we will get this discounted rate in the future.

The proposed contract is in annual payments, I assume you would prefer this to be quarterly?  Are there any other considerations on your end or is it okay to renew?
 
We would need to sign before February 4th to receive the 25% discount on accounts.
 
Cheers, 
Will

**Checks**
Hi Joe, 
 
Thanks again for sending this along.  Two more (hopefully quick) questions, then I think our Finance team would be ready to sign and renew.
- What needs to happen by February 4th to secure the discount on additional accounts?  Signing the contract?
- Could the payments be quarterly instead of annual?  That is strongly preferred.

Cheers, 
Will

**Confirm with CFO**
Hi Tony, 
 
I just wanted to confirm the final draft of our Looker renewal for approval. 
 
The final cost is $60K a year, (~ £53K), paid quarterly.  We negotiated no additional service fees, the only difference from the $47K previous contract is 20 more accounts over more months.  Accounts@papier should start seeing charges from the new contract on April 1st.
 
Cheers, 
Will

### Fivetran contract renewal 
Hi Lynn, 

I reviewed our historic MAR and forecasted budget.  
 
I believe the two scenarios you should draft for the renewal proposal are:
- The exact same MAR & credits we bought last year 
- What the next tier up would look like.  What MAR, credits, and efficiencies do we gain by purchasing more upfront?I would expect the proposal for scenario 1) to look a lot like last year's.  We can weigh that against the efficiencies we would gain on the next tier up.
 
When do you believe you can have a draft ready for review?
 
Let me know if you have any questions or need any more from me,
Will


Hi Lynn, 

Thanks for kicking off the process and sending the proposal over.  This prompted a few additional questions for me though.  
- You mentioned 28,000 credits is double our usage, but as of May, I would estimate we use ~21,000 credits.  Am I miss interpreting the data at all?
- Is there any additional cost to buying incremental credits in the year?  More specifically from your pricing options .ppt, if we purchased 25,333 credits for $20K.  Would we be able to increase to 28,000 credits for an additional $3K in the year? 
- Do you know why there is such a dramatic increase from last year's contract?  I have us purchasing 26,000 for $12,000 in 2020. I would hope similar discounting would be available?
Cheers, 
Will



This is great, thanks.  

Can we grab 30min sometime next week?  

I'm still having a hard time understanding the MAR vs credits for our projections, so I think it will be easier to talk through it in person.  Also, I'd like to talk about the price increase and if there is any room to negotiate (without the same level of heavy discount).

Will
