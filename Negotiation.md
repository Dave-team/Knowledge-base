# Negotiation

## Principles
- Look for win-win decisions. 
- If you don't like the agreement, simply back off. 'We’d love to do business with you but this deal is just not for us. Let’s get together on something else later'
- Give and take: we reciprociate each other. Try to get what matters most and give what matters least 
- Never take on any problems and transfer as many problems as possible to their side
- Always ask for more than you expect 
- Never agree with a first offer / never say yes the first time around
- When asked for a concession, always ask for something in return
- Play good cop bad cop – someone really excited and then someone who is really struggling with the pricing 
- Show that you are willing to eat shit to get to the right price and conditions – be very critical and demanding 
- Generally, AE’s can give up to 40% discount. Any higher discounts would need to be approved by those above the AE’s
- Hold ground as long as possible 
- Make sure you’re talking to the right person around the table 
- Always double check anything in writing, especially contracts. Often, it is not actually the same as what you both agreed upon 
- When someone says no: what about this doesn’t work for you? Or it seems like something is bothering you

## Process
Preparation
- Understand first what the other party wants. Put yourself in their shoes
- Establish a clear agenda prior to the agenda 
- Anticipate what questions might pop up 
- Know your goals and best, expected and worst outcome for the negotiation
- Establish a walk away point 
- Do your homework: benchmark prices vs competitors, know what’s happening in the markets, understand their price structure and where there margins are at 
- Have a best alternative: if negotiations don’t go through, know that you have things left in the pipeline. This is your BATNA
- Always have multiple factors on the table to negotiate on. So not only price but e.g. online	delivery times

Meeting
- Establish common ground and interests
- Never assume you understand what the other side means – ask many questions to understand, even stupid questions 
- Understand their pricing structure deeply which can help leverage down the line
- Lead communication and steer it into the direction you need it to go to. Don’t be afraid of cutting people short 
- Never directly believe what someone says: we cannot do this, we cannot give you this. Dig deeper here and find workarounds to get what you want. 
- Don't believe any numbers thrown on the table - they will be overstated
- Show surprise when they mention e.g. their price, even when it doesn’t actually surprise you. This will help later on in the negotiation 

### Ways to negotiate
- Some arguments that might work: 
    - High growth 
    - Large volumes
    - Introductions to other businesses
    - Promise on SLA's
    - New 'logo' for their client base - perhaps a new industry or vertical for them
    - Promise to provide a case study
    - Ability to sign a longer term contract
- Practical tips:
    - Mention your total budget and that you need to fit in that budget for things to work
    - Negotiate deals at month end / quarter end to get good deals 
    - Clarify that you want to move quickly and any investments that are larger than X would require you to go to the board, which would be a slower process. Both parties want to sign the deal ASAP

## Phrases to use
- “You have to do better than that”. Then, shut up
- “Why?”
- “How is that?”
- “Why not?”
- “So you are telling me that” 
- “I don’t believe that”
- “Let me check and I’ll come back to you on this matter”
- “How do you mean?”
- “Is there anything else”
- “What can you do with the price”
- “Is that your absolute best?”
- What is the difference between yourselves and X (cheaper priced alternative)
- What support do you offer
- What are some features/tools that your company is working on to stay ahead of the competition?
- Why did the last two clients cancel their contracts? Who are they using now? Can we call them?
