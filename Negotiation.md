# Negotiation

## Principles
- Look for win-win decisions. 
- If you don't like the agreement, simply back off. 'We’d love to do business with you but this deal is just not for us. Let’s get together on something else later'
- Give and take: we reciprociate each other. Try to get what matters most and give what matters least 
- Never take on any problems and transfer as many problems as possible to their side
- Always ask for more than you expect - you can always lower afterwards 
- Never agree with a first offer / never say yes the first time around
- When asked for a concession, always ask for something in return
- Play good cop bad cop – someone really excited and then someone who is really struggling with the pricing 
- Show that you are willing to eat shit to get to the right price and conditions – be very critical and demanding 
- Generally, AE’s can give up to 40% discount. Any higher discounts would need to be approved by those above the AE’s
- Hold ground as long as possible 
- Make sure you’re talking to the right person around the table 
- Always double check anything in writing, especially contracts. Often, it is not actually the same as what you both agreed upon 
- When someone says no: what about this doesn’t work for you? Or it seems like something is bothering you
- Always get everything in writing 
- If you don’t come to an agreement about something, set the issue aside and go on to another topic
- Always keep the north star in mind (what is it that we are really after) 
- When given a no, dig deeper for the why. what about this doesn’t work for you? Or it seems like something is bothering you
- Always understand pricing structure as this can be used to your advantage. 
- If you can’t negotiate on price, negotiate on something else: free period, different payment terms, etc. 
- Work in terms of percentage discounts. E.g. they give a quote below the list price. Figure out what percentage discount that this (e.g. 30%) and then set aims as to how much you’re willing to pay. In this case, aim for 40% discount so say the number that represents that percentage discount

## Process
Preparation
- Understand first what the other party wants. Put yourself in their shoes
- Establish a clear agenda prior to the meeting 
- Anticipate what questions might pop up 
- Know your goals and best, expected and worst outcome for the negotiation
- Establish a walk away point 
- Do your homework: benchmark prices vs competitors, know the prices competitors are getting, know what’s happening in the markets, understand their price structure and where there margins are at 
- Have a best alternative: if negotiations don’t go through, know that you have things left in the pipeline. This is your BATNA
- Always have multiple factors on the table to negotiate on. So not only price but e.g. online	delivery times

Meeting
- Establish common ground and interests
- Never assume you understand what the other side means – ask many questions to understand, even stupid questions 
- Ask for reasons why things are the way they are 
- Understand their pricing structure deeply which can help leverage down the line
- Lead communication and steer it into the direction you need it to go to. Don’t be afraid of cutting people short 
- Never directly believe what someone says: we cannot do this, we cannot give you this. Dig deeper here and find workarounds to get what you want. Don't be afraid to say that you don't believe them and dig deeper to understand where they get their numbers from 
- Don't believe any numbers thrown on the table - they will be overstated
- Show surprise when they mention e.g. their price, even when it doesn’t actually surprise you. This will help later on in the negotiation 

### Ways to negotiate
- Some arguments that might work: 
    - High growth 
    - Large volumes
    - Introductions to other businesses
    - Promise on SLA's
    - New 'logo' for their client base - perhaps a new industry or vertical for them
    - Promise to provide a case study
    - Ability to sign a longer term contract
    - Can sign quickly
- Practical tips:
    - Mention your total budget and that you need to fit in that budget for things to work
    - Negotiate deals at month end / quarter end to get good deals 
    - Clarify that you want to move quickly and any investments that are larger than X would require you to go to the board, which would be a slower process. Both parties want to sign the deal ASAP
- Benchmark: Is what they’re asking fair? Is this a usual price or are we actually paying more? If possible, benchmark 
- Ask if it’s possible to do something with the price AND PROVIDE CONTEXT AROUND WHY YOU’RE ASKING FOR A DISCOUNT. We’d want to create a story rather than a hard request. 

## Phrases to use
- “You have to do better than that”. Then, shut up
- “Why?”
- “How is that?”
- “Why not?”
- “So you are telling me that” 
- “I don’t believe that”
- “Let me check and I’ll come back to you on this matter”
- “How do you mean?”
- “Is there anything else”
- “What can you do with the price”
- “Is that your absolute best?”
- What is the difference between yourselves and X (cheaper priced alternative)
- What support do you offer
- What are some features/tools that your company is working on to stay ahead of the competition?
- Why did the last two clients cancel their contracts? Who are they using now? Can we call them?

Hi Philip, 
 
Great meeting you last Friday and excited to see what’s ahead in the roadmap! 
 
Agreed that we’re slightly over our user licenses. We have had a lot of org changes recently which have caused this. Two questions around the proposed contract:
- We’re closer to having 35 users and in the past we've been able to add increments of 5 - can we increase our user licenses by 5 now, and then another 5 when we will move towards 40?
- I was wondering if there is more room to discount the new users? The wedding market (our core business) has been really challenged since COVID and we're trying to save wherever we can as a business. Would a monthly cost of $50 per user be possible?  
Thanks,
 
Dave
