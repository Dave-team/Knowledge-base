## Sources
Other than Awesome lists, look into MacOs, WatchOs, IOs, Chrome extensions, 

## Hardware
Alexa
- Use Soundsleeps for bedtime sounds. Say 'Play for 15 minutes' to ensure it stops on time 

Kindle 
- Use Calibre to add books to Kindle. Any Epub books need to be converted first in Calibre to Modi format 
- Whilst reading, highlight passages on Kindle (we can also add notes here). On Calibre, we can open 'My clippings'. We can also 'Fetch Annotations' (Send to Device > Fetch Annotations) to work on annotations directly from Calibre without having the Kindle connected 
- Alternative way to handle highlights: Clippings.io (free) and ReadWise (paid) 

## Apps 
### Productivity 
Todoist 
- All checkbox kind of to-dos 
- Quick notes that pop up in my mind 
- Reminders
- Books to download 
- List of things to buy
- Notes to put in journal
- Great because it seemingly works between macOS and iOS

Google Docs 
- Longer form write up of notes that should go into Knowledge Base 
- Snippets of learnings from articles / books 

Notes app 
- Longer term To-Dos. I.e. the project I need to work on instead of the projects I can just check off 
- To Do file split between: 
    - To do Today 
    - To do This Week
    - To do This Month 

Evernote 
- Recipes (paid alternative here is Paprika)
- Notes that are long term but don't belong in the knowledge base and need to be easily accessible
  - For example travelling packing lists
  - Workout schedule 
  - Passport photo
  - Card info
- To save clips from whilst I'm reading things online

Other productivity tools
- Omnifocus (10 dollars / month) but extremely nice looking productivity app 
- Things - nice UI but just a simple task manager - pricing is divided between different devices adding up to 70 USD across my devices
- Bear: more of a writing app but it's sync between devices make it great for notes - probably a paid for alternative to Evernote (it's cheap at 1.49 / month)
- Notion: could have a homepage with all most important priorities. Would be a good place to host knowledge base for easy access (i.e. apps on mulyiple devices
