## Sources
Other than Awesome lists, look into MacOs, WatchOs, IOs, Chrome extensions

## Hardware
Alexa
- Use Soundsleeps for bedtime sounds. Say 'Play for 15 minutes' to ensure it stops on time 

Kindle 
- Use Calibre to add books to Kindle. Any Epub books need to be converted first in Calibre to Modi format 
- Whilst reading, highlight passages on Kindle (we can also add notes here). On Calibre, we can open 'My clippings'. We can also 'Fetch Annotations' (Send to Device > Fetch Annotations) to work on annotations directly from Calibre without having the Kindle connected 
- Alternative way to handle highlights: Clippings.io (free) and ReadWise (paid) 

Anne Pro 2:
Connecting Anne Pro 2 to iPad: Turn on Bluetooth on the back of keyboard. Press FN2 + 1 to set Bluetooth connection 1 and then connect

## Apps 
### Productivity 
Todoist 
- All checkbox kind of to-dos 
- Quick notes that pop up in my mind 
- Reminders
- Books to download 
- List of things to buy
- Notes to put in journal
- Great because it seemingly works between macOS and iOS

Evernote 
- Save web clips on iPad and Mac whilst I'm reading things online without having to copy directly into the app or a Google Doc
- We can export notes file file>export. We can export to either HTML or Evernote format 

Google Docs 
- Longer form write up of notes that should go into Knowledge Base. Not sure whether this will still be used paralel to Evernote web clips
- Snippets of learnings from articles / books. Perhaps not needed with GoodReads 

GoodNotes
- Annotate PDF / books 
- Make notes whilst multitasking on the iPad
- Migrate highlights / notes from Goodnotes Mac to Knowledge Base 
- Auto backup to Google Drive is enabled

Notes app 
- Longer term To-Dos. I.e. the project I need to work on instead of the projects I can just check off. To Dos split between: 
    - To do Today 
    - To do This Week
    - To do This Month 
- Notes that are long term but don't belong in the knowledge base and need to be easily accessible across all devices 
  - Goals/habits/affirmations
  - Travelling packing lists
  - Workout schedule 
  - Passport photo
  - Card info
- Journal as it's simple to create new note by day in separate folders

Pocket
- Bookmark URLs to read later - alternative to keeping bookmarks in the browser 

Alfred 
- Search for folders/files on machine 
- Search in bookmarks using keyword bm 
- Search any website: Gmail, Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia, Maps: just type "Twitter" in Alfred 
- Define words using "Define" + word 
- Spell words using "Spell" + word 

Notion
- Storing longer term tabular things that I'd like to track: bucket list, films, docus to watch, great films seen, whisky, wine, cigars, etc.

Google Calendar and Mac Calendar app: Google Calendar to set up events and Mac Calendar app for notifications, multi device calendar tracking
Paprika as a recipe manager


Other productivity tools not used:
- Omnifocus (10 dollars / month) but extremely nice looking productivity app 
- Things - nice UI but just a simple task manager - pricing is divided between different devices adding up to 70 USD across my devices
- Bear: more of a writing app but it's sync between devices make it great for notes - probably a paid for alternative to Evernote (it's cheap at 1.49 / month)
- Spark: email client. I just don't have any issues with email and I don't use it that much 
- Fantastical: paid for calendar app. I am fine using Mac / iOS Calendar
- Ulysses for writing - I don't really see the additional benefit over Notes considering my use cases
