# Public Speaking 

## Principles
- Make the presentation a good experience for your audience 
- WIIFTA: What’s in it for the audience? Make your presentation appropriate for the audience you’re presenting to. Make sure they get the necessary info without boring them with details they don’t care about. Aim to deliver something with a message that drives action or provokes thought
- Make a separate version. If your slides need to stand on their own, that’s understandable. Sometimes not everyone can make the live presentation. However, the deck that you use that can stand on its own shouldn’t be the same version that you use when you’re presenting with it.
- If using video, make sure to narrate so people understand what they’re looking at
- Think about the questions that might be asked 
- Spend more time on key topics – don’t rush through and let it sink in
- Make sure to avoid possible obvious questions
- When you use memes, reference them to actually make it funny 
- A good is where the audience learns something new or comes away with a change in perspective 
- Focus on the value you're bring to the audience. Rather than providing your credibility, articulate a questions they'd love to have an answer to. 
- Take every opportunity to speak in public 
- Enthusiasm is the most vital factor in public speaking. You want your thoughts, actions and words to harmonize. To influence others, we must express ourselves in line with our own beliefs. 

## Slides
- Only use slides that provide value
- Don’t include text – this means people won’t listen to you anymore
    - Use a picture on your slides 
    - Keep slides to 1 statement or phrase or conclusion per slide
    - Use few, big words
    - If you do really need bullet points, limit them to 3
    - If you do need to provide text, make it appear one at a time so people will still listen instead of read
    - When seated, sit relaxed and backwards
    - Don't fiddle with something
- Make use of highlights and callouts to draw the eye.
- The combined headers in your slides should tell a coherent story  
- A good reference is that we can spend 1-2 minutes on each slide  
- When you introduce a more complex visual, make sure it gets loaded on the slides step by step. Add new elements one by one whilst explaining each individually to the audience.
- A longer presentation can have topic header slides throughout 

## Preparation
- Consider the audience: 
    - Who are they?
    - What is an important question we can answer for them?
    - What would I like them to remember from the talk a year from now? 
- First, write down the high level outline - the high level story you want to tell 
- Then write out the entire presentation 
- Practice: 
    - First practice until you can present a coherent story with the main points. Each time, focus on thibngs you could improve
    - Then record yourself and practice in front of a mirror 
    - Then do a dry run in front of others. Ask them what they got out of it. If not much, back to drawing board  
    - Constantly reiterate and improve during this process
- Create cue cards 
- Really know your topic to be conversational - this also eliminates the need to memorize 
- Understand the logistics of the presentation: 
    - Where will I stand
    - Will I have a microphone
    - How large is the audience? 
    - What tools will be avaiable - make sure to test with those tools

## Presenting
- Use cue cards
- Interact with the audience: ask questions/opinions/ask for hand raises 
- Use eye contact throughout the entire audience: 3-4 seconds per face 
- Body languange
    - Confident
    - Show energy and enthusiasm
    - Smile 
    - Use gestures to add to the points you are trying to make. Don't make excessive gestures as that limits the influence 
    - When not using your hands, place them by your side. You could also hold something in your hands if that helps 
- Speaking
    - Speak loudly
    - Pause more frequently. Especially when making a point, pause first and pause after. Bring home the points you’re trying to make
    - Use different tonality and avoid speaking monotome. E.g. use ascending melody in your sentences - start low and end higher. Also use various volumes. 
    - Practice articulating by opening your mouth - be able to place 2 fingers in mouth whilst speaking your words. 
- When waiting until it's my turn and I can't escape - i.e. during all hands or team meetings, try to distract yourself by focusing on what's being said, by taking notes and/or by focusing on people in the audience: how are they doing? What are they looking forward to this weekend? The goal is to get out of your own mind. 

## Structure
**Intro**
- Gain interest: Use stories/ anecdotes and examples
- Reveal topic
- Establish credibility to speak about topic
- Relate topic to audience
- Two options: 
    - More formal presentation: reveal what the different topics are
    - More of a story: say what you're going to speak about but don't list agenda items and take people with you on a story

**Body**
- Content of the presentation

**Conclusion**
- Summarize and conclude. Emphasize impact 
- End with a persuasive statement/ call to action/ deep impact statement

**Q&A**
- Make sure to understand questions asked by repeating them or by putting them in your own words
- Involve everyone in the answer
- Ask: “Does this answer your question?”
- Pause to buy time
- No need to answer every question. Offer to follow up with research
- Ask more questions to really understand what is meant
- Thank you audience and tell them you enjoyed them 

## Dealing with nerves
You have to identify the root of your performance anxiety. Are you worried that: You don’t know the material? You can’t answer a difficult question? Your presentation is boring? You don’t come off as expert? You look stupid? You sound unpolished? Your material doesn’t flow? Nobody will show up? People don’t understand you? The audience doesn’t care? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more. 

- Speak as often and as much as possible 
- Every presentation is an experiment. Each time you try to do the best you can prepare for. I know I need to speak in public and I know I struggle with it. I will feel nerves and there is some imposter syndrome. However, each time I try to prepare, do what I can control and that's it. The rest just happens and needs to be accepted - one I do, there will be a sense of calm which will automatically improve performance. 
- Let go of anything that is not within control: Maybe it will go well, maybe it won't. I'd like it if it did, but it's not the end of the world if it doesn't, and it's not even really under my control. So relax, and enjoy it.
- Focus on the fact that you want to give value to the audience – that is the main goal of me talking – the audience needs to come out smarter. They don’t actually care about the presentation in and off itself so I am not the main focus point here. 
- Over time, I will be established as an authority and need to speak frequently both at the company as well as larger events – each presentation is small compared to the next. And at each presentation I am representing my own brand
- Be grateful for opportunities you get (e.g. when presenting to be higher up the foodchain). Have the strong tendency to prove yourself and get the word out 
- Visualize yourself giving plenty presentations being good at it and loving to do it. 
- Realize that the audience will never be aware of the things you’re doing wrong and people are wrapped up in their own lives far too much anyway
- Look into good public speakers and see how they do it and then try to replicate their behaviour. Focus on: 
    - Storytelling approaches you like (lessons learned, “here’s something I did!”, best practices, etc…)
    - Speaking styles that resonate with you (formal/informal, witty/dry, etc…)
    - Structure of the talk and how slides are designed

Pratical tips on the day: 
- Some nerve reducing tactics pre presentation: 
  - Meditation
  - Breathwork
  - Walks
  - Listen to music
  - Speak to as many people as possible to reduce the pressure
- Distract yourself when others are speaking and you're not up yet: take notes, focus on your breath, engage, use a repetitive mantra
- A great tactic is to start off with interaction with the audience. This should massively drop the nerves during the rest of the presentation

## Virtual meetings
- Ask people to add questions in the chat to avoid distractions 
- People don’t interact, but e.g. can say: ‘I see some nodds, which is good
