# Public Speaking 

## Principles
- Make the presentation a good experience for your audience 
- WIIFTA: What’s in it for the audience? Make your presentation appropriate for the audience you’re presenting to. Make sure they get the necessary info without boring them with details they don’t care about. Aim to deliver something with a message that drives action or provokes thought
- Make a separate version. If your slides need to stand on their own, that’s understandable. Sometimes not everyone can make the live presentation. However, the deck that you use that can stand on its own shouldn’t be the same version that you use when you’re presenting with it.
- If using video, make sure to narrate so people understand what they’re looking at
- Think about the questions that might be asked 
- Spend more time on key topics – don’t rush through and let it sink in
- Make sure to avoid possible obvious questions
- When you use memes, reference them to actually make it funny 
- A good is where the audience learns something new or comes away with a change in perspective 

## Slides
- Only use slides that provide value
- Don’t include text – this means people won’t listen to you anymore
    - Use a picture on your slides 
    - Keep slides to 1 statement or phrase or conclusion per slide
    - Use few, big words
    - If you do really need bullet points, limit them to 3
    - If you do need to provide text, make it appear one at a time so people will still listen instead of read
    - When seated, sit relaxed and backwards
    - Don't fiddle with something
- Make use of highlights and callouts to draw the eye.
- The combined headers in your slides should tell a coherent story  
- A good reference is that we can spend 1-2 minutes on each slide  
- When you introduce a more complex visual, make sure it gets loaded on the slides step by step. Add new elements one by one whilst explaining each individually to the audience.
- A longer presentation can have topic header slides throughout 

## Preparation
- Consider the audience: 
    - Who are they?
    - What is an important question we can answer for them?
    - What would I like them to remember from the talk a year from now? 
- First, write down the high level outline - the high level story you want to tell 
- Then write out the entire presentation 
- Practice: 
    - First practice until you can present a coherent story with the main points
    - Then record yourself
    - Then do a dry run in front of others. Ask them what they got out of it. If not much, back to drawing board  
    - Constantly reiterate and improve during this process
- Create cue cards 
- Really know your topic to be conversational - this also eliminates the need to memorize 
- Understand the logistics of the presentation: 
    - Where will I stand
    - Will I have a microphone
    - How large is the audience? 

## Presenting
- Use cue cards
- Interact with the audience: ask questions/opinions/ask for hand raises 
- Use eye contact throughout the entire audience: 3-4 seconds per face 
- Body languange
    - Confident
    - Show energy and enthusiasm
    - Smile 
    - Use gestures to add to the points you are trying to make. Don't make excessive gestures as that limits the influence 
    - When not using your hands, place them by your side. You could also hold something in your hands if that helps 
- Speaking
    - Speak loudly
    - Pause more frequently. Especially when making a point, pause first and pause after. Bring home the points you’re trying to make

## Structure
**Intro**
- Gain interest: Use stories/ anecdotes and examples
- Reveal topic
- Establish credibility to speak about topic
- Relate topic to audience
- Two options: 
    - More formal presentation: reveal what the different topics are
    - More of a story: say what you're going to speak about but don't list agenda items and take people with you on a story

**Body**
- Content of the presentation

**Conclusion**
- Summarize and conclude. Emphasize impact 
- End with a persuasive statement/ call to action/ deep impact statement

**Q&A**
- Make sure to understand questions asked by repeating them or by putting them in your own words
- Involve everyone in the answer
- Ask: “Does this answer your question?”
- Pause to buy time
- No need to answer every question. Offer to follow up with research
- Ask more questions to really understand what is meant
- Thank you audience and tell them you enjoyed them 

## Dealing with nerves
- Similar to the notes in principles but some additions below
- The audience will never be aware of the things you’re doing wrong 
- When nervous, think not of yourself. Instead, think of the audience
- Over time, I will be established as an authority and need to speak frequently both at the company as well as larger events – each presentation is small compared to the next. And at each presentation I am representing my own brand
- Focus on the fact that you want to give value to the audience – that is the main goal of me talking – the audience needs to come out smarter. They don’t actually care about the presentation in and off itself 
- Look into good public speakers and see how they do it and then try to replicate their behaviour. Focus on: 
    - Storytelling approaches you like (lessons learned, “here’s something I did!”, best practices, etc…)
    - Speaking styles that resonate with you (formal/informal, witty/dry, etc…)
    - Structure of the talk and how slides are designed
- A great tactic is to start off with interaction with the audience. This should massively drop the nerves during the rest of the presentation
- Be grateful for opportunities you get (e.g. when presenting to be higher up the foodchain). Have the strong tendency to prove yourself and get the word out 
- Visualize yourself as being someone who loves being right in the centre of attention because everybody is keep on listening to you and understand what it is you have to say. Be more influential and funny – be who you want to be
