# Public Speaking 

## Principles
- Make the presentation a good experience for your audience 
- WIIFTA: What’s in it for the audience? Make your presentation appropriate for the audience you’re presenting to. Make sure they get the necessary info without boring them with details they don’t care about. Aim to deliver something with a message that drives action or provokes thought. This also means you need to understand who is in your audience first. 
- Make a separate version. If your slides need to stand on their own, that’s understandable. Sometimes not everyone can make the live presentation. However, the deck that you use that can stand on its own shouldn’t be the same version that you use when you’re presenting with it.
- If using video, make sure to narrate so people understand what they’re looking at
- Think about the questions that might be asked 
- Spend more time on key topics – don’t rush through and let it sink in
- Make sure to avoid possible obvious questions
- When you use memes, reference them to actually make it funny 
- A good is where the audience learns something new or comes away with a change in perspective 
- Focus on the value you're bring to the audience. Rather than providing your credibility, articulate a questions they'd love to have an answer to. 
- Take every opportunity to speak in public 
- Enthusiasm is the most vital factor in public speaking. You want your thoughts, actions and words to harmonize. To influence others, we must express ourselves in line with our own beliefs. 
- Highlight the main principles a few times to get it across fully.
- To speak about something, you don’t need some amazing knowledge. Instead, just share your experience
- The audience wants you to succeed.

## Slides
- Only use slides that provide value
- Don’t include text – this means people won’t listen to you anymore
    - Use a picture on your slides 
    - Keep slides to 1 statement or phrase or conclusion per slide
    - Use few, big words (minimum font size 24 pt)
    - If you do really need bullet points, limit them to 3
    - If you do need to provide text, make it appear one at a time so people will still listen instead of read
    - When seated, sit relaxed and backwards
    - Don't fiddle with something
- Make use of highlights and callouts to draw the eye.
- The combined headers in your slides should tell a coherent story  
- A good reference is that we can spend 1-2 minutes on each slide  
- When you introduce a more complex visual, make sure it gets loaded on the slides step by step. Add new elements one by one whilst explaining each individually to the audience.
- A longer presentation can have topic header slides throughout 
- Include slide numbers

## Preparation
- Consider the audience: 
    - Who are they? How technical are they?
    - What is an important question we can answer for them?
    - What would I like them to remember from the talk a year from now? 
- Ask the event organizer: 
  - Decribe the audience. How technical are they? Why do they attend? 
  - What kind of talks have been the most successful? Is the event oriented around technical talks or strategic talks? Is there an expectation of demo-ing code? Do they have past examples of talks that were well-received, or any tips?
  - What are the event logistics?
    - Length of talk
    - QA at the end?
    - If virtual, how is the tech set up?
    - If in person, bring own laptop? How do I connect? What sort of screen is there?
  - Is there an opportunity for topic feedback? Is the organizer interested in working with you to make your topic great? If not, can they point you to someone in their community who might be interested in helping out?
  - Are there any additional accessibility considerations you should be aware of? Do any audience members use a communication device? Can you share your slides ahead of time to make them easier for audience members to access? Will the event be recorded for those who can’t attend in person?
- First, write down the high level outline - the high level story you want to tell 
- Then write out the entire presentation 
- Practice: 
    - First practice until you can present a coherent story with the main points. Each time, focus on things you could improve. Always practice out loud > take notes whilst practicing > fix slides/script > repeat. 
    - Then record yourself and practice in front of a mirror. Watch the recording and analyse what you do.
    - Then do a dry run in front of others. Ask them what they got out of it. If not much, back to drawing board  
    - Constantly reiterate and improve during this process and practice in a way that you'd like to present. E.g. include the pauses, sips of water etc. where relevant. 
- Create cue cards 
- Really know your topic to be conversational - this also eliminates the need to memorize 
- Understand the logistics of the presentation: 
    - Where will I stand
    - Will I have a microphone
    - How large is the audience? 
    - What tools will be avaiable - make sure to test with those tools

## Analytics presentation 
1. **What is the business problem?** Relating to a business problem helps audience members understand why you undertook a project. For example:
   1. The finance team didn’t trust our numbers
   2. We were never sure what led to an increase in customer conversion
   3. The data team couldn’t find a balance between ad hoc requests and roadmap work
   4. Our tracking across mobile and web was completely inconsistent
2. **How did this manifest?** Include evidence that this is a genuine problem — this helps create buy-in from the audience. Slack screenshots, quotes, charts, etc. are all good here!
3. **What tactics were used to solve the problem?** Three feels like a good number here. Make sure to emphasize people and process solutions as well as technology solutions.
4. **What was the impact on the business problem?** Since you set out a problem to be solved, it’s worth revisiting it. It’s okay if you found that your project didn’t go as planned — there’s a valuable lesson in there. Again, including evidence of improvement feels valuable.
5. **What other things were learned, and/or what next steps are you taking?** Summarize high level lessons that others can take-away, and potentially talk about what you’d do differently, or what you plan on doing next.

Slides: 
At the start:
- An intro slide for yourself (and teammates)
- An intro slide for your company — you might also include some impressive numbers about your business, after all, your audience is full of people who love numbers!
- Potentially include your tech stack for context — there’s no need to spend too much time on this, most audience members will be familiar with the tools.

Before diving into the specific tactics used:
- Use a slide to list the three tactics at a high level — this signposting helps set expectations for audience members.

At the end:
- A closing slide to prompt questions, and list your contact details.
- If your company is hiring, mention that too!

## Presenting
- Use cue cards
- Interact with the audience: ask questions/opinions/ask for hand raises 
- Use eye contact throughout the entire audience: 3-4 seconds per face 
- Body languange
    - Confident
    - Show energy and enthusiasm
    - Smile 
    - Use gestures to add to the points you are trying to make. Don't make excessive gestures as that limits the influence 
    - When not using your hands, place them by your side. You could also hold something in your hands if that helps 
- Speaking
    - Speak loudly
    - Pause more frequently. Especially when making a point, pause first and pause after. Bring home the points you’re trying to make. Take sips of water to force these pauses
    - Use different tonality and avoid speaking monotome. E.g. use ascending melody in your sentences - start low and end higher. Also use various volumes. 
    - Practice articulating by opening your mouth - be able to place 2 fingers in mouth whilst speaking your words. 
- When waiting until it's my turn and I can't escape - i.e. during all hands or team meetings, try to distract yourself by focusing on what's being said, by taking notes and/or by focusing on people in the audience: how are they doing? What are they looking forward to this weekend? The goal is to get out of your own mind. 

## Structure
**Intro**
- Gain interest: Use stories/ anecdotes and examples
- Reveal topic.
- Establish credibility to speak about topic. Keep your bio short - people already know your credible - that's why you're presenting!
- Relate topic to audience / what the audience will know by the end
- Two options: 
    - More formal presentation: reveal what the different topics are
    - More of a story: say what you're going to speak about but don't list agenda items and take people with you on a story. Agendas can spoil the fun of a more spontaneous presentation.
- (Optional) Executive Summary at this stage already

**Body**
- Content of the presentation

**Conclusion**
- Summarize and conclude. Emphasize impact 
- End with a persuasive statement/ call to action/ deep impact statement
- Executive Summary which is the exact same as the one presented around the intro.

**Q&A**
- Make sure to understand questions asked by repeating them or by putting them in your own words
- Involve everyone in the answer
- Ask: “Does this answer your question?”
- Pause to buy time
- No need to answer every question. Offer to follow up with research
- Ask more questions to really understand what is meant
- Thank you audience and tell them you enjoyed them 

## Dealing with nerves
You have to identify the root of your performance anxiety. Are you worried that: You don’t know the material? You can’t answer a difficult question? Your presentation is boring? You don’t come off as expert? You look stupid? You sound unpolished? Your material doesn’t flow? Nobody will show up? People don’t understand you? The audience doesn’t care? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more. 

- Nerves are there to help your brain work better during the presentation. They show that you care. 
- When presenting, being focused on yourself will cause anxiety, voice issues etc. Why do you present? To get a point across you believe in. The only focus should be to get your point across and we want to deliver value to the audience. 
- Chest to the front and chin up. Be comfortable being nervous if you are. You are a lot more than the performance at this single presentation. Own it. Nerves are a natural response of my body preparing me for the moment that's to come. 
- Speak as often and as much as possible. 
  - Join an improv class or Toastmasters to facilitate in this
  - Try speaking a lot more in low pressure situations. At work, lead a team meeting. Outside of work, speak to the people in shops.
- To some extend, do it to get out of your comfort zone on purpose. Truly dive in and own it. 
- Accept that there will be nerves but you'll present and do your best regardless. 
- Every presentation is an experiment. Each time you try to do the best you can prepare for. I know I need to speak in public and I know I struggle with it. I will feel nerves and there is some imposter syndrome. However, each time I try to prepare, do what I can control and that's it. The rest just happens and needs to be accepted - one I do, there will be a sense of calm which will automatically improve performance. 
- Let go of anything that is not within control: Maybe it will go well, maybe it won't. I'd like it if it did, but it's not the end of the world if it doesn't, and it's not even really under my control. So relax, realize this will pass and enjoy it.
- Over time, I will be established as an authority and need to speak frequently both at the company as well as larger events – each presentation is small compared to the next. And at each presentation I am representing my own brand
- Be grateful for opportunities you get (e.g. when presenting to be higher up the foodchain). Have the strong tendency to prove yourself and get the word out 
- Visualize yourself giving plenty presentations being good at it and loving to do it. 
- Realize that the audience will never be aware of the things you’re doing wrong and people are wrapped up in their own lives far too much anyway
- The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone
- They don’t actually care about the presentation in and off itself so I am not the main focus point here. 
- Look into good public speakers and see how they do it and then try to replicate their behaviour. Focus on: 
    - Storytelling approaches you like (lessons learned, “here’s something I did!”, best practices, etc…)
    - Speaking styles that resonate with you (formal/informal, witty/dry, etc…)
    - Structure of the talk and how slides are designed

Pratical tips on the day: 
- Stay focused on other goals before the moment
- Some nerve reducing tactics pre presentation: 
  - Meditation
  - Breathwork
  - Walks
  - Listen to music
  - Speak to as many people as possible to reduce the pressure
  - Power pose in the bathroom
- Distract yourself when others are speaking and you're not up yet: take notes, focus on your breath, engage, use a repetitive mantra
- A great tactic is to start off with interaction with the audience. This should massively drop the nerves during the rest of the presentation

Experiences BI monthly presentation
Days leading to the presentation: fear of fear - fear of my anxiety impacting the presentation. I know now that if I focus on the techniques such as slowing down and breathing, I can ground myself and not let the nerves carry my presentation. And it helps to stay busy as that ensures we don't have the time to dwell on the worries. And just realize that we're going to die anyway so it makes sense to just get the most out of all situations. 

I also spent more time than usual trying to visualize the logitistics. E.g. I can be influenced by seeing senior people or seeing people seemingly not enjoying the presentation. I visualized those instances and my response. Oh - the CFO is here - great he is putting time in this - I expected this. Oh - this person looks bored - he's probably thinking about it. Avoid surprises and avoid getting caried away in this way. 

Pre presentation: excited. This is the body preparing for giving a good performance. It releases hormoses that cause increased heartbeat, increased breathing and great alertness. This stress is good - no need to change it or try to control it. Used music and movement to feed in the excitement and not get carried away by it. Was calm by myself when I started to speak. 

Became more nervous as Nikita was presenting. Listening with awareness I to what he was saying helped me not being in my head. Sometimes I had judgement around how well he was presenting which increased my anxiety.

When axiety rose, I: 
- Took a deep breath trying to ground myself
- I told myself I’m doing great so far 
- I saw the fun in what we’re doing and I told myself I’m excited to speak (as a mantra), I'll try to slow down and deliver a good presentation regardless of how the others perform. This is again feeding in to the excitement - it's a choice to like what I was doing. Flow like water and enjoy the ride. 
- When the body was reacting and feelings of nerves increased I changed my body language to be more open and focus on the breath. 

During the presentation, I focused most of all on slowing down and ensuring I paused enough for the content to land. 


## Virtual meetings
- Ask people to add questions in the chat to avoid distractions 
- People don’t interact, but e.g. can say: ‘I see some nodds, which is good
