# Startups

## Principles
- Value is created by doing
- Figure out the right thing to work on
- Ship early and improve only later 
- You don't really want a viable product - you want a minimum desirable product. It's the minimum possible to create a great user experience that solves their problems
- Pursue those ideas that you just can’t possibly stop thinking about
- When thinking about customers, make sure you offer things to existing customers first
- Create unique customer experiences 

## Goals 
- Have one main goal in the company and it should be visible to anyone in the company 
- You always want to clarify your vision, mission, strategy, and metrics and build a mission oriented team around this 
- Mission: what is the goal (practical e.g. yearly goal), how will  you achieve that goal, perhaps fairly granular, then some more granular metrics and finally the total amount spent 

## Strong founders
- Strong founder problem fit. Clear reason why this founder is right for this problem to solve. This can be technical, domain and product knowledge and experience
- Complementary skill set (e.g. technical vs business) in the founders and they work well with one another. 

## Evaluating ideas
- What is the potential market? Is it big enough?
- Is it a big enough problem in the target market?
- Does the idea/product solve that problem in a very good way? 
- Is there a significant edge or is it easy to copy? Competitive edges include technology, network effect, or any other barrier of entry. 

## Lean startup approach
Build - Build the absolute minimum you need to show to users – Minimum Viable Product
Measure – Bring it to the customers and measure results
Learn – go deep into what you’ve been measuring. Best way initially: talk to the users personally, do customer service. 

## 4 Market fits 
**Product Market fit**
you need a solution that solves a problem in the market. Finding this fit always takes multiple iterations and it is not binary not at a single point of time. These things evolve and you need to always be improving. 

Product/Market Fit: refers to the extent to which a given product satisfies a (good) market demand. Product-market fit is often seen as the single most important factor in a start-up. Product Market Fit is there when 40% of active 	users are saying that they would be “very disappointed” when they would not be able to use the product 

Signals of product market fit: 
- NPS
- Retention curves (ideally these are flat)
- Direct traffic (result of word of mouth)
- If you turned off all marketing today, would you keep growing? Ideally, the answer is of course yes 
- Product market fit survey. Get an understanding of: category, who, problems, motivations of your intended end users. Also, get a good understanding of the product hypothesis elements: 
  - Core Value Prop. What was the core value prop of the product? How did it tie to the core problem?
  - Hook. How could the core value prop be expressed in the simplest terms?
  - Time To Value. How quickly could we get the target audience to experience value.
  - Stickiness. How and why will customers stick around? What are the natural retention mechanisms of the product?

**Model/Market fit**
The idea here is that when you have low annual revenue per customer, you need a lot of customers, whereas if you can get a lot of annual revenue per customer, you only need a select few customers. You want to calculate whether: ARPU x total customers in the market x % you think you can capture > £100M. The adv-  however is still to start with a niche market and then then expand out. Just make sure that in all the expansions, you can get to a good number.  

**Channel/Model fit**
if your model is low ARPU, you can’t really spend a lot on CAC. 

**Product / Channel Fit**
products are built to fit channels. Channels don’t mold to products.
- Virality requires quick time to value, broad value proposition, network makes product better  
- Paid marketing requires quick time to value (conversions need to happen quickly) 
- UGC SEO: enable users to create loads of content, motivate users to contribute  

## Other
- Pivot: structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model and engine of growth. Therefore, it is in a way related to the question as to whether the initial “strategy” was good enough or whether a change ought to be made. It happens in the phase during which the start-up is looking for a repeatable and scalable business model. 
- Disruption: “New Market Disruption”: a business model/ product that addresses a market that previously couldn’t be served “Low-end disruption”: a product offers a simpler, cheaper or more convenient alternative to an existing product
