## Principles
- Startups have as a goal to build something that customers want. 
- Value is created by doing
- Figure out the right thing to work on
- Ship early and improve only later 
- You don't really want a viable product - you want a minimum desirable product. It's the minimum possible to create a great user experience that solves their problems
- Pursue those ideas that you just can’t possibly stop thinking about
- When thinking about customers, make sure you offer things to existing customers first
- Create unique customer experiences 
- Get the important things right and let the little things go.
- One mistake great founders make: fire people too slowly. Remember that you hurt people more when you keep them along for too long.
- The #1 thing during the early stage period is the speed of decision making and moving quickly.
- Concrete planning and long term thinking is important in starting a startup. So even though plans in themselves are quite worthless, the exercise of planning is highly valuable.
- Really keep things lean in the beginning and do things that don’t scale.
- Be focused on one channel at a time: work full-time on something and see if it works. If it does, build further on it, if it doesn’t, quit it. This is better than working 4 weeks part-time on various projects.
- Be a small fish in a big pond so you have the opportunity to actually build a monopoly. And then expand. 
- Move fast and don’t be afraid to break stuff. Be really hungry for growth that is the key
- Early customers can get angry and disappointed - this should be seen as a positive as it shows they care. 
- Necessity is the mother of invention: you’ll find a way to make it work.
- Very important is to get things perfect only for a couple of users. Only after that is established, you can start looking for ways to scale it and make it perfect for a lot more people. A large mistake companies are making is that they try to do both at the same time.
- The productivity at a startup is defined by whether what is done is actually getting closer to building (or validating, for that matter) a sustainable business. Productivity at a startup is systematically figuring out the right thing to build. 
- Early stages is all about validated learning - experiments and measurement - use the scientific method. The goal at startups is to learn as quickly as possible, and for that you need to have the mindset of building the absolute minimum that can still contribute to validated learning. Anything else is a form of waste. 
- A question that every company needs to ask is: will this business still be valuable 10 years from now? When a company is growing quickly and rapidly, that’s amazing – but how endurable is it? If it’s an app, when will growth stagnate and can you make more apps repeatedly? 
- Before you build anything and spend time on it, ask yourself: can this really become as valuable? So, focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before doing that, make sure it’s worth doing, which is determined by whether it will be valuable in the future
- PR might not necessarily give you a ton of customers and it never should be a single source of traction, but it does help with potential new employees and investors who read up on you. 

## Startup fundamentals
4 main parts in any start-up. These are:
1. Idea
2. Product 
3. Team
4. Execution

Start-up success = idea * product * team * execution * luck

## Ideas
The goal of a startup idea should be to have really good ideas that look bad and work on those. Look for new technologies - need to be an independent thinker and go deep. Get conviction there is a market by starting to grow. 

‘What important truth do very few people agree with you on?’. And the business version of this is: ‘what company is nobody else building?’

To know you are working on the right things, do the following:
1. Give a chunk of time in your schedule to devil’s advocacy. Find the smartest person you can find, have them destroy your idea, find everything wrong with your idea, be a huge asshole, and have the permission to do this.
2. Do a pre-mortem. Pretend that you started the idea and failed already — forecast what went wrong and try to identify all of the deadly risks early. We may decide to bail or keep going but if we keep going we can put in shock absorbers for those key risks

The idea has to be good enough to start with. Great execution on a bad idea is still not going anywhere. So ideas do matter a lot but you have to be flexible. Important is to have an idea that can develop in multiple ways. If you have multiple ideas, chose the one where you keep thinking about. Always be very convinced in your own beliefs, but do be flexible.

The best ideas often look terrible at the beginning. If an idea sounds really good, there are probably already others who have done it. Truly good ideas sound so crazy that people often don’t want to get involved, which decreases the competition since nobody would want to compete with you. The first idea has to be unpopular but right. The best ideas are very different from existing companies or totally new. A clone of some sort or making something slightly better is often not sustainable. Think about what the market and the customer want first.

In evaluating an idea, the question Why Now is important. Why not two years ago? And why should it be done now, and not within the next two years?

Best thing in evaluating an idea is to be working on something you need. Start-up idea has to be put in one clear sentence. Easy to explain and very easy to understand. 

You need to have a small market in which you create and have a monopoly and then you can expand. A small market and good opportunities for rapid and big expansion.
The growth rate in any market is really important. Therefore, start-ups should be focused on acting on a small and rapidly growing market, instead of a big and declining or mature market.
In these markets, the customers are generally very happy with a product that is not perfect.
Very often, start-ups are not able to build a market from zero onwards. So make sure that the market is growing and it will be there later. You have to know about the growing markets in the world to be able to attack certain markets.

The best way to get startup ideas is not to think about startup ideas. Often, they instead start as side projects because they don't sound like viable business options. 

To come up with ideas:
1. Live in the future by becoming a leader in a certain technology. You will see things that are obvious to you but are questioned by other people. You will not recognize them as startup ideas but you do know it is something that ought to exist. This is normally how many startup ideas happen
2. Learn powerful things and that should be the added value of education: really getting great knowledge about certain things.
3. Number 2 happens with a healthy breed of natural born curiosity, which lets you learn all of those things.
4. Become a domain expert in what you are doing because you are interested in it. These things do not come from business school, but from specific domain knowledge that can be gained

## Product 
Step one is building something users want and love. At the start of the business, either work on product or talk to customers. You have to start with something that is simple and then make it better. Better to have something few people love instead of more people like.

You have to get extremely close to the initial users and work a lot with them. The feedback you get is the thing that lets you develop and improve the product. 

Metrics focused on growth:
1. Total registrations
2. Active users
3. Activity levels
4. Cohort retention
5. Revenue
6. Net promotor score

Then, you start working on a product: a minimal viable product: minimal feature set to solve the problem that you are trying to solve. When talking to users: have one very clear line that describes the benefit of the product.

Customer feedback:
1. Customer support is very important and one amazing source of customer feedback
2. Surveys are ok, interviews are better
3. Quantitative: retention, ratings, Net Promotor Score
4. Qualitative: ask why, why, why
5. Beware of honesty curve (see below)

If users ask for other features, really go deep: why do you want this other feature? They probably have a certain problem not yet solved and the feature they see as a solution might not be optimal. So: ask why. Remember that the users have a problem but they are not the ones who might come up with the perfect solution. You are the founder and so you should come up with that.

The beginning of it is simply to really test the idea, find out if it is worth pursuing. So really hack things together and do things that don’t scale. Be the delivery driver, be the customer support. Don’t focus on complicated stuff in the beginning. Instead, really focus on the user and just get it done. Just try to get it off the ground. 

## Goals 
- Have one main goal in the company and it should be visible to anyone in the company 
- You always want to clarify your vision, mission, strategy, and metrics and build a mission oriented team around this 
- Mission: what is the goal (practical e.g. yearly goal), how will  you achieve that goal, perhaps fairly granular, then some more granular metrics and finally the total amount spent 

## Strong founders
- Clarity of vision: can the founder explain well what they do and why?
- Determination and passion: don’t take no for an answer and bent the world to their will. Be mission oriented
- Raw intelligence
- Get things done quickly. Speed and quality of decision making.
- The key trait: being presented with a problem you have never seen before that is very hard and then being able to solve it really quickly.
- Strong founder problem fit. Clear reason why this founder is right for this problem to solve. This can be technical, domain and product knowledge and experience
- Complementary skill set (e.g. technical vs business) in the founders and they work well with one another. Also in mindset - e.g. black and white thinker vs grey thinking 

## Lean startup approach
It should be the startup’s main goal to validate this (the ‘grand vision’) as soon as possible, using hypothesis. There are two hypothesis:
1. Value hypothesis: does the product really deliver value to customers once they are using it?
2. Growth hypothesis: how will new customers discover the product or service?

With the Lean Startup, this is the Build – Measure – Learn framework. The goal is always to make the total time to go through this loop as little as possible. IT should enter the Build phase with an MVP – a product that enables the full cycle with as little as possible effort. 
In the Measurement phase, Innovation accounting is required, where you keep metrics and see whether any experiments are bearing any fruit. The planning is reverse: you decide what you want to learn, you decide on the metrics that will give that data and then you decide on the minimum product that will answer those questions. 

Build - Build the absolute minimum you need to show to users – Minimum Viable Product
Measure – Bring it to the customers and measure results
Learn – go deep into what you’ve been measuring. Best way initially: talk to the users personally, do customer service. 

## 4 Market fits 
**Product Market fit**
you need a solution that solves a problem in the market. Finding this fit always takes multiple iterations and it is not binary not at a single point of time. These things evolve and you need to always be improving. 

Product/Market Fit: refers to the extent to which a given product satisfies a (good) market demand. Product-market fit is often seen as the single most important factor in a start-up. Product Market Fit is there when 40% of active 	users are saying that they would be “very disappointed” when they would not be able to use the product 

Signals of product market fit: 
- NPS
- Retention curves (ideally these are flat)
- Direct traffic (result of word of mouth)
- If you turned off all marketing today, would you keep growing? Ideally, the answer is of course yes 
- Product market fit survey. Get an understanding of: category, who, problems, motivations of your intended end users. Also, get a good understanding of the product hypothesis elements: 
  - Core Value Prop. What was the core value prop of the product? How did it tie to the core problem?
  - Hook. How could the core value prop be expressed in the simplest terms?
  - Time To Value. How quickly could we get the target audience to experience value.
  - Stickiness. How and why will customers stick around? What are the natural retention mechanisms of the product?

**Model/Market fit**
The idea here is that when you have low annual revenue per customer, you need a lot of customers, whereas if you can get a lot of annual revenue per customer, you only need a select few customers. You want to calculate whether: ARPU x total customers in the market x % you think you can capture > £100M. The adv-  however is still to start with a niche market and then then expand out. Just make sure that in all the expansions, you can get to a good number.  

**Channel/Model fit**
if your model is low ARPU, you can’t really spend a lot on CAC. 

**Product / Channel Fit**
products are built to fit channels. Channels don’t mold to products.
- Virality requires quick time to value, broad value proposition, network makes product better  
- Paid marketing requires quick time to value (conversions need to happen quickly) 
- UGC SEO: enable users to create loads of content, motivate users to contribute  

## Other
- Pivot: structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model and engine of growth. Therefore, it is in a way related to the question as to whether the initial “strategy” was good enough or whether a change ought to be made. It happens in the phase during which the start-up is looking for a repeatable and scalable business model. A pivot is a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.  
- Disruption: “New Market Disruption”: a business model/ product that addresses a market that previously couldn’t be served “Low-end disruption”: a product offers a simpler, cheaper or more convenient alternative to an existing product

## Sustainable startups 
A common pitfall for startups is also that they are relying heavingly on the early adapters market and not think beyond that because their early adaptors are providing them with lots of growth. 

A startups growth needs to be sustainable, meaning that new customers come from the actions of past customers and it doesn’t take into account one-offs, such as PR stunts and other launches. It is about getting new customers where the CAC < LTV.There are 3 ways:
- Churn < Acquisition
- Viral growth: every customer brings on board 1+customer
- CAC < LTV

## Early users
You'll need to get creative and manually recruit them. Build something people want and then tell them about it. The only thing you really need to know is the wants of your users. 
Show up at places where people are.
This company took weeks of deep search to find those users as it wasn’t easy. The first inch is the hardest. Really use the first users to learn. Make sure users value the product and so do not just give away the product for free. Create tremendous customer experience by doings things unusual and out of the ordinary. Basically this comes down to talking to users and really valuing and listening to them.

## When to start a startup 
Important to remember is that you don’t start a start-up for the sake of starting a start-up. Instead, you should start a start-up when you have an idea and starting a startup is the only way you can get this idea out in the world. Do not just start a start-up for the sake of starting one. Only start one if you feel compelled by a particular problem and starting a startup is the best way to solve it.

1. Entrepreneurs can’t keep it inside them and the idea just bursts out. The founder starts to irrationally allocate time and resources to this new idea because they literally just can’t stop thinking about it. While they are working on the idea, if time just disappears and you miss two meals because you are so engrossed in your work — it’s a good sign it’s an idea you have to get
out of your system.
2. The other characteristic is when the founder accidentally gets their friends fired up too. The friends keep thinking about the idea as well and want to work with you on it.

Starting a start-up is extremely hard and quite stressful. It is so stressful because:
1. You have lots of responsibilities: not only your own, also the ones of your people you work with. You are responsible for opportunity costs of their time
2. You’re always on call: no real time off
3. You are responsible for raising the necessary funds

Important to remember is that you will not be the boss: instead, you will get to hear a lot of problems that other people will bring to you and you always need to anticipate on that. Its constant decision making and prioritizing.

## How to raise money 
- Be so good they can't ignore you. Have a product - show growth. 
- Have a strong pitch: be very good in simply explaining what you do. 30 second pitch: what does your company do? How big is the market? How much traction do you have? Assu􏰁e that the person you’re talking to knows nothing and apply the mom test: your mom has to understand it. The traction should show the investors how fast the team is moving
- Two minute pitch: First, the clear 30 second pitch. Then, unique insight: what do others don’t do well, know or understand. So why you are going to kill competitors, or the really intelligent thought that got the business started. You need to have the AHA moment. So you have to be understandable and say something that the investors didn’t know yet. Then: how do you make money? Can be anything, ads, sales or whatever. Make it simple. Then, team: focus on the strength of the team. If you started
a successful company, do share it. How many are you? When is the background/ how many biz and how many tech people? How long have you known each other? Ideally, you know each other at least 6 months and you have to share where you have met. Then, the big ask: do use jargon at this point. Know you’􏰄e stuff, do you want to raise convertibles/ safe or anything like that.

## Other
Characteristics of a monopoly:
1. Proprietary technology: technology that is hard to replicate, like Google’s algorithm. It should be at least 10X as good as its closest substitute
2. Network Effects – products that are more useful if and when more people use it. The best companies start with network effects on very smart scale (Facebook: Harvard students)
3. Economies of scale – software can scale as the marginal costs of adding customers is low. A yoga studio is hard to scale
4. Branding – having a strong and solid brand in the marketplace will give you a monopoly

Building a monopoly:
1. Start with a (very) small market that you can dominate
2. Once a specific segment is dominated, move to other parts in the market, but this should be a slow and gradual process – dominate every small increment. 
3. Don’t disrupt anything – that is competing against. Instead, create something new. Actually go from 0 (nothing) to 1 (your company)
4. First mover advantage doesn’t exist is someone else builds something better than you. Either be the first and continue to be the best or take advantage of last mover advantage

	- Demonstrate you company’s value proposition to make the customer’s 	life better
	- Differentiate from other solutions 
	- Provide use cases 	
5. Why now 
	- Show the history of the category
	- Define recent trends that make the solution possible 
6. Market size 
	- Identify/ profile the customer the company goes after
	- Calculate the TAM (top down), SAM (bottom up) and SOM
7. Product 
	- Product line-up (form factor, functionality, features, architecture, 	intellectual property).
	- Development roadmap
8. Business Model

## Evaluating startups 
In judging a company, four elements play a key role:
- Proprietary Power — The key insight of your product
- Product power — Product Market Fit
- Company power — Business model and company culture 
- Category Power — Defining your market

Ron Canway in deciding whether or not to invest in a company: from the first minute of talking with someone he asks himself (and at the same time is able to identify) whether someone is:
- a leader.
- obsessed by the product.
- what was the inspiration? Hopefully a personal problem the founder has had and then the product is a solution to that problem.
- Communication skills. As a leader and for hiring people, excellent communication skills are needed. 
- Be very good in telling what the product does within one minute.
- Be decisive. Procrastination is one of the biggest problems in start-ups.

**Proprietary Power**
Proprietary is the technical insight the product and company is built on top of. Proprietary power
doesn’t only stem from technical innovation, other examples include:
- Access to scarce supply — Ex. De Beers having access to diamonds.
- Creation of high switching costs — Ex. Keurig, once you buy the coffee machine you have to buy the coffee pods.
- Network Effects — creates lock-in for both consumers and suppliers. Ex. LinkedIn having network effects on your professional identity.
- Authentic team 

**Product Power**
Ability to achieve product market fit: there is a large and growing market for your product and the demand literally feels uncontrolled.

**Company Power**
Company power is broadly broken up into a few pieces:
- The scalable business model which sustains your company
- The cultural values of your company
- The narrative of why your company exists
- The compensation model which develops and rewards talent
- Career paths for your employees
- The communication within your company and the culture around how you communicate.

**Category Power**
Creating an entire new category where competition is not relevant. Category power is the ability for the founders to think about the language of the market they are going into, and how they define this for their company. If they are allowing the existing market to

Evaluating ideas
- What is the potential market? Is it big enough?
- Is it a big enough problem in the target market?
- Does the idea/product solve that problem in a very good way? 
- Is there a significant edge or is it easy to copy? Competitive edges include technology, network effect, or any other barrier of entry. 

Every business must answer 7 questions:
1. Engineering: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. Timing: Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. Monopoly: Are you starting with a big share in a small market?
4. People: De you have the right team?
5. Distribution: Do you have a way of distributing your product?
6. Durability: Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years in the future?
7. Secret: Have you identified a secret that others don’t see?
