# Drawing

## Drawing inspiration: 
- Draw from image: Image stored from somewhere. Then have it as a window in Procreate. Pick the right colours to create a pallet and start drawing 
- Draw along Youtube
- Instagram
- Draw over image within Procreate - e.g. make things surreal
- Doodle
- Sketch
- Draw from imagination
- Can build a collage

## Drawing technique
- Draw from the shoulder - don’t draw from the finger tips and don’t draw for the wrist
- To understand the angle of an object, hold the pencil horizontally or vertically first. Then see how the object measures from this baseline - that’s the angle to draw in
- To understand proportions, use a pencil and measure how much of the pencil is attributable to a specific part of the object we’re trying to draw 
- Lay out the measures of an object first: draw a spoon. First, draw a line. Then 3 lines: top of spoon, end of spoon, where the tip begins. Then draw loose lines from the shoulder connecting the elements 
- Contour drawing is when we carefully look at an object and try to mimic what it looks like - in all its detail 

## Drawing exercises 
- Take a single object and draw all the angels. E.g. draw a block/phone 20 times and each time in a different angle 

## Drawing tips
**Sketching**
- Sketch using HB pencil 
- Use the smudging tool to fade some earlier drawing and play with it to make it better 
- Option is to keep the initial outline in a different layer and then add a layer to make things more specific and clean. A good tip with this is to reduce the opacity of the initial layer as well. 

## General
- Use the liquify tool to change edges and corners within the drawing
- Draw e.g. a line or circle and then hold so if can make it perfectly round / straight. There is then an option to ‘Edit Shape’. 
- Made an ellipse. Then hold one finger on the screen and it’ll turn it into a perfect circle. Same for triangle, square
- Rather than moving the iPad, move the page you’re drawing on 

## Layers
- Rename layers by one click and then rename
- We can hide layers which can be helpful in certain situations
- Click on the “N” of a layer to adjust that layer’s settings 
- Reorder layers to also reorder within the painting itself 
- Merge layers by simply pinch the layers together from the menu
- Select layers by swiping right on them
- The background color can be easily changed from the background layer 

## Selection tool
- Select what you want 
- Hit the dot to complete selection 
- Then hit invert to make what you want striped. Then hit invert and you can remove the entire background. 
- Swipe down with three fingers from what is just selected (or just from the entire layer) and then we can cut/copy the selection. This is then directly added to a different layer so we can work with this separately now 
- Automatic. Then select and hold and slide to the right / left to select what you’d like

## Copying something
- Go to Actions
- Copy
- This will select what you just created on the layer
- Paste - this will add the element that we can now move 

## Gestures 
- Double tap to revert what you just did (undo)- can also hold to do things more quickly 
- Three taps to go one step forwards (redo)
- Tap with 4 fingers to hide the interface and focus on the drawing 
- ‘Pinch and pull’ gesture to go back to the main display size

## Other
- Duplicate something: 
    - Group different layers into a group 
    - Duplicate layer
    - Move the layer 
- Symmetry: Drawing guide on and then play around with the symmetry. This will then allow to create symmetrical lines 
- The Quick Menu is used to quickly access different options and tools 
- Only allow doing something within a selected shape: build something. Then go into that Layer’s settings and hit ‘Select’. Any next layer will then only allow to do things within the previously selected layer
- The grid view on the drawing guide can be really helpful to line things up nicely. 
- Adjustments: Play around with it to adjust color, tones etc. of the image / painting 
- Setup tips
  - Set setting curve so that we don’t need to press too hard to start drawing
  - Disable touch actions to not have the finger create lines 

## Brushes and eraser
- Reorder brushes: click, drag and drop
- Can favourite brushes
- For the eraser to match the brush, hold the eraser button 

## Colors
**Color menu**
- Disk: 
    - Outer circle of disk is the hue
    - Inner circle = brightness / saturation of the color. Can pinch in on the inner circle to zoom in further 
    - Save a color by tapping on one of the squares in the color menu 
- Classic: 
    - This is great for selecting ‘extreme’ colours: e.g. black or completely white
- Values: use this when you have the hex numbers

When painting, we may want to mix coolers. E.g. take two circles and make a Venn diagram. Light brush between the two - sampling a color and continue to paint and repeat until a nice desired color is achieved. This way we can also create our own color scale

**Other color notes**
- Color picker: put your finger on the color you want, then you can draw with that colour. Hit the middle of the sidebar - that also enables the colour picker tool 
- Tap and hold the color Botton to switch between current and previously chosen color
- Drag the color drop tool to what you want to color. Make sure the edges are all connected to enable this. We can drag to the left / right and the amount of space we are colouring will change 

## Masks
- Alpha lock: only allow changing the area that currently has paint on it 
- Clipping mask: with parent layers, add layers that are clippings. This gives complete control over individual layers in the artwork. You’ll create a new layer that can only operate on the parent layer. A big advantage of this over the alpha lock is that not everything needs to sit within one single layer. This works great with the transformation layer



Things to draw
- Mountain landscape using the freehand Selection control tool
