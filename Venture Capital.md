# Venture Capital 

## Rounds of investment:
- Friends and Family & Seed (normally occurs pre-launch). This is the riskiest investment, since there might not be a business yet. Also, angels might investment at this stage. 
- Pre-Series A. Venture Capitalists and Angels support the first growth of the company
- Bridge. In a bridge round, a company raises a convertible note in order to continue growing. Often used to get companies to the next financing round. Usually the bridge is provided by existing investors and is structured as a loan that converts into shares when the company raises its next round.   
- Series A. To further build on the already existing growth, extra money is often needed. VC’s, angels groups and strategic partners are generally leading the round. 
- Series B & Beyond. To even further expand business, these series are needed, which are again led by institutional investors. 

Other options:
- Bootstrapping a business (using no outside investment and running the company on a “shoestring” budget
- Incubation: a long term program where the incubator takes an amount of equity in an early-stage startup in exchange for access to mentors, knowledge 	and experts. 
- Crowdfunding
- Acceleration: Same as incubation, but shorter term and less equity stake

## Company valuation
Startups are valued based on many variables. Some factors playing a role are:
- Market conditions within the specific industry
- Management team of the company
- Growth rate / Traction (e.g. users, revenue, EBITDA)
- Market size
- Competition
- Supply and demand of money
- Recent exits of similar companies
- The willingness of an investor to pay a premium
- Similar recent investments in similar companies 
- And the list goes on 

Also, the way that a start-ups is valued is based on a variety of techniques, unique per company and unique per industry.
Methods used for valuation
- Multiple on revenue or EBITA or users etc. (most likely based on the 	multiples of similar companies, since the start-up often doesn’t have enough traction). If the start-up is more mature, the multiples can be based on the performance of the new venture. 
- For pre-revenue companies, multiples do not work. In this case, one way is to estimate how much a venture would be worth if it achieved all its milestones. Then, multiple this with the probability that the company is able to achieve this. This is also called the “Bottoms-up method”
- Valuations based on similar companies that recently received funding 
- “Instinctual valuations”: valuations driven by an investor’s sector experience about what the average type of deal is priced at both at entry (when they invest) and at exit.
- Top-down approach: investors estimate the company value at exit and from 	those, they determine a range of valuations that that will allow them, to some extend, to meet their returns expectations.
- Another way is to look at the gross sales + 20*current (or forward) year 	estimated EBITDAs). Basically, you take the average of these two numbers to get to a midpoint. So, the number in the first year (which is an average of the current years gross sales and the forward year gross sales) could serve as the 	initial investments. When everything goes well, the midpoint at the end of e.g. year 3 or 4 would serve at the return. When the return midpoint/ initial midpoint is between 5-7, the investment is good from the investor side. 

From a VC side, the VC always has a particular return in mind. So, he or she guesses what the exit size could potentially of the company of the type and within its industry. Then, he judges how much equity his fund should have in the company to reach his return on investment goal. 
The % of the investor is calculated as follows = investment amount / post-money valuation of the company
VC’s often look at the Cash on Cash Multiple: the amount of money the investor receives / investments within the company.
