# Sales
## Communication 
- Always smile, be positive and act enthusiastically
- Always focus on the key issue that is presented by the (potential) customer
- Keep asking “Why?”
- In being a good listener, be sincerely interested in what the person is saying; give him all the attention and appreciation that everyone craves but seldom gets
- Let the prospect summarize 
- Repeat question of the prospects
- People often have two reasons for doing something: one that sounds good and a real one. To get to the real one, use two questions: “Why?” and “In addition to that…”?

## Principles
- Believe in and know what you sell
- A demonstration says more than a thousand words
- Never forget a customer
- Sell the interview or the meeting before you sell the product
- Personalize the usefulness of the product to the specific customer
- Always focus on the direct benefit for the customer
- Use power statements. E.g. sell safe, financially secure families protected from tragedy instead of insurance. Don’t sell cars but prestige, status and smooth ride
- Focus on the negative prevention; show discontent with current situation, Tell them how they’ll safe money, because they pay more now, or overcome fear or eliminate worry or get more done, etc. 
Focus on the challenges of the customers
- Make sure that you establish trust
- Act as their guide and navigator
- The goal in any sales activity is to get to the next step, whatever that might be
- You have to ask in order to get
- Make extensive use of up and cross selling, as this will turn out a lot cheaper than acquitting new customers all the time. The goal is to keep CAC as low as possible 
- When calling, it is recommended to ask for permission – to get to permission, play your cards right 
- Make use of testimonials, other people like you have achieved this and this with the product
- You are selling the product or service for the people and need to deeply believe this
- Close whenever appropriate, sometimes you do not need to finish the pitch
- A sale is made on every call. The prospect either sells you why he/she doesn’t want it or you 	close it
- Ask for information, most people are willing to give it
- Always ask whether there are any further points or concerns that need to be addressed 
- If you get a lot of objections early in the call, you have focused too much on offering solutions, instead of really identifying the needs of the customer
- If you get many questions about the value you offer, you have to develop stronger needs
- Start with a clearly and personalized value proposition: we help data centers reduce their power and cooling energy consumption from 13 to 79%
- Make sure to turn implied needs (the problem they’re having but maybe not totally aware of) into explicit needs (where the customer agrees there is a problem and wants to solve it) 
- Always reflect after activity:
  - Did I achieve my objective?
  - If I were to do the same call again, what would I do differently? 
- Questions to be answered by potential customers
  - Do you like it
  - Do you want it
  - Can you afford it
  - When do you want to start enjoying the benefits?  
- Four outcomes to any sales activity 
  - Order
  - Advance: you move up a step in the sales funnel (e.g. closer to decision maker
  - Continuation: sale will continue but no specific action has been agreed upon by the customer to move it forward
  - No sale: where the customer refuses a commitment
- 5 prerequisites for a close:
  - A recognized need
  - A viable solution
  - Value must justify the costs
  - A sense of urgency
  - Authority to buy 

## Laws of influence and persuasion
- Law of time: changing someone’s time perspective helps them make different decisions
- Law of contrast: when two things that are different are placed and mentioned together, the difference are perceived higher
- Law of friends: when a person is asked to perform something by a friend, they are more likely to follow through
- Law of expectancy: when a person is asked to perform a task by someone they respect, they are more likely to follow through
- Law of association: people tend to like things that are endorsed by individuals they like and respect
- Law of conformity: most people tend to agree to things that will be perceived as acceptable by the majority of other people
- Law of power: people have power over others to the agree that they are perceived as having greater authority, strength or expertise

## SPIN questions
1. Situation questions: data gathering about customers current situation
2. Problem questions: exploring problems and difficulties and dissatisfactions in areas where	the product can help
3. Implication questions: taking a customers problem and explore its effects, helping the customer understand a problem’s seriousness. Goal is to justify action
4. Need-payoff questions: questions about the value or usefulness of solving a problem. “Why would… be beneficial to you?” So the customer tells you the benefits. 

## Rejection
- Do not agree with the first no. Instead you should hear “tell me more”. This is when it gets exiting, really find the product suited for the customer
- Persistence is key
- Always deal with objections by asking questions
- Respond to objections by asking if they will buy once their objections are dealt with
- Process
  - Listen carefully
  - Agree at first
  - “Is that the only reason why you are not buying with us today”?
  - If the issue can be solved, go on with the sale. “So if I could solve it, would that be enough to make a decision?” and then close 

## Process
- Qualify your leads first by doing research 
- Write a sales script. Improve it over time: 
  - Write down objections and find ways to deal with them
  - Write down a list of questions and figure the best way to handle these, based on the type of customer you are selling to 
- Prepare for any call or meeting
  - What do they do? 
  - What are their potential problems? 
- Make sure that you have personas you can direct your sales efforts and preparation towards 

## Power questions
1. Make a factual statement that cannot be disagreed with
2. Make a personal observation that reflects your experience and creates credibility
3. Ask an open question that incorporates first two stages 

Example:
1. Shipping is costly and time consuming
2. My experience has shown me that business often are not able to receive good rates, while  at the same time being able to give good service
3. How are you ensuring high service and still low costs for your customer delivery?

## Sales call
- Always have clear objectives before any call or meeting
- Start of the call – make them agree that you can ask them some questions:
  - Explain who you are
  - Explain why you are calling (without giving product details) 
  - Ask them for the right to ask questions 
- Start any sales talk with qualifying questions, and only then come to the point
- Always make sure that you get to the direct decision maker
- Make sure to track anything during a call (the why’s, the reasons, the competitors mentioned, etc.)
- Four stages of a sales call:
  - Preliminaries: what you say before the actual selling begins (your intro and start of the conversation). The customer here gives you access to ask questions and they should become curious
  - Investigating: finding stuff out / qualifying the lead based on questions. You find out what the customer wants (pain points) and then help finding the best way to get it. Do this by asking questions and listening carefully 
  - Demonstrating capability: convincing the customer that you have something to offer. This is also initiating change:
    - The problem needs solving
    - The problem is big enough
    - You are helping the company achieving its aims
    - They feel the need to change
    - They realize that status quo is not longer acceptable
    - Help them to understand what the possibilities are when they work with you
  - Obtaining commitment    
    - Convince the customer of using your product
    - Act as an advisor
    - reate a roadmap and make it as simple as possible
    - Be invaluable, so they do not only look at price

## Other
Four steps in an average sale:
- Attention
- Interest
- Desire
- Close

**Example script**
Hello, this is Dave van Heukelom from Coureon. 
I am calling related to your eBay shop, do I then have the correct person in front of me?
Ok perfect. The reason I am calling today is because we have developed something that enables online merchants to save time as well as money on their shipments, (both national and international). 
What would really interest me at this moment is how exactly you handle your shipments?
From there, relate to their shipment method: they might use a provider you know is fairly expensive – then mention the price. They’ll benchmark from that and if you are cheaper, that’s a massive point of interest and take it from there
