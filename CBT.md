# CBT 

## Fundamentals
Cognitive Behavorial Therapy is a form of psychotherapy. A central idea in CBT is that our thoughts about an event or experience powerfully affects our emotional, behavioral, and physical responses to it.

When understanding something, notice:
- Physical reactions: What physical symptoms am I having? 
- What mood am I experimenting?
- What behaviors are connected to my moods? 
- What thoughts do have? About myself? About other people? It's important to be critical about thoughts and check their accuracy. Once a mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen the mood - the problem is when the mood is strong we are no longer rational

## Thought record 
When we feel a strong mood, complete a Thought Record: 
- Make sense of your emotional reactions
- See the bigger picture and don't react with a narrow and possibly distorted view
- Over time, it'll help you think more flexibly. Over time this can lead to easier control of moods and thoughts 
- By writing down a thought record, we likely decrease the perception of danger coming from our anxiety. 

A Thought Record consists of: 
1. Situation: Who, What, When, Where
2. Moods
  - What did you feel? (moods are described in single words). See below for tips on recognizing moods.
  - Rate each mood (0-100%)
  - Any physical reactions caused by the mood?
3. Automatic Thoughts 
  - What was going through your mind in the situation? Any thoughts, beliefs, images, memories and meanings attached to the situation. We often don’t plan/intend these thoughts, they just happen. See the list below for questions that help identify automatic thoughts. 
4. Evidence that supports the hot thought 
5. Evidence that does not support the hot thought. See below for tips
6. Alternative / Balanced Thoughts 
   - Write an alternative or balanced thought. See below for tips around this
   - Rate how much you believe each thought 
7.	Rate moods now: Rate column 2 moods and any new moods 

**How to identify moods**
- Pay attention to the body: tightness, closed
- Do it more often: notice three different moods each day
- Think back at past situations and identify moods 

**Questions to help Identify automatic thoughts**
-	What was going through my mind?
-	What am I afraid might happen? 
-	What is the worst that could happen?
-	What does this mean about me? 
-	What does this mean about how the people? 

**Finding evidence**
Think of your automatic thoughts as hypotesis. Don't take them as truth and look at them for what they are - thoughts made up in my mind that are likely strongly enforced because of the mood I'm feeling 

-	Have I had any experiences or is there any information that suggests that this thought is not completely true all the time?
-	If my best friend or someone I loved had this thought, what would I tell them?
-	If my best friend or someone who cares about me knew I was thinking this thought, what would they say to me? What factual evidence would they point out to me that suggests my hot thought is not 100% true?
-	Are there any small pieces of information that contradict my hot thought that I might be ignoring or discounting as not important?
-	Are there any strengths or qualities I have that I am ignoring? What are they? How might they help in this situation?
-	Are there any positives in this situation that I am ignoring? Is there any information that suggests there might be a positive outcome in this situation?
-	Have I been in this type of situation before? What happened? Is there anything different between this situation and previous ones? What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me understand this situation differently?
-	When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this type of situation any differently? How? What factual information do I focus on?
-	When I have felt this way in the past, what did I think about that helped me feel better?
-	Five years from now, if I look back at this situation, will I look at it any differently? Will I focus on any different part of my experience?
-	Am I jumping to any conclusions in columns 3 and 4 that are not completely justified by the facts?
-	Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control? What facts can I write down that reflect a more fair, compassionate, or kind view of my responsibility?

**Questions to help arrive at alternative or Balanced thinking**
What you want to do is collect evidence in favor of the alternative thought until you believe it much more. 
-	Now that the evidence is considered, is there an alternative or balanced way of thinking about or understanding this situation? Often it's a combination of columns 4 and 5. 
-	If someone I cared about was in this situation, had these thoughts, and had this information available, what alternative view(s) of the situation would I suggest?
-	If someone who cares about me knew I had my hot thought(s), what might this person say is another way of understanding this situation?

## Accepting our thoughts
Sometimes, we need to step back and let go of our critical self. Acceptance of thoughts and moods is sometimes a worthwhile alternative to identifying, evaluating, and changing thoughts. Acceptance involves observing your thoughts, moods, and physical reactions without making judgments about them. Be curious rather than critical. 
Think about the bigger picture. What are the benefits of accepting this rather than being distressed? Are you focusing on only the negative parts of this experience and not recognizing other dimensions? Are there aspects to the situation that counterbalance the negative parts? If you can accept the parts that distress you, will you be able to enjoy or appreciate the rest of your experience more easily?

## Testing our assumptions
Often, anxiety is described as 'If...Then' statements. "If I speak - people will think X"

To overcome these assumptions, create experiments: 
-	Experiment: what experiment do I plan to do?
-	Prediction: what will happen based on my underlying assumptions? E.g. If I speak then I'll make a fool of myself. 
-	Possible problems: what problems might interfere with the experiment 
-	Strategies to overcome these problems: What is the plan to overcome these problems? 
-	Outcome of experiment: write down in detail what actually happens: 
  - What happened?
  - Do the outcomes match what you predicted?
  - Did anything unexpected happen?
  - If things didn’t turn out as you wanted, how well did you handle it?
-	What have I learned from this experiment about this assumption? 

## Challenging core beliefs 
Core beliefs are all-or-nothing statements about yourself, others, or the world. Identifying core beliefs by repeatedly asking yourself, “What does this mean about me?” E.g. I'm not interesting enough

Instead of testing our negative core beliefs, it is usually more helpful to identify new core beliefs that we would like to hold, and then look for evidence to support or strengthen these new core beliefs. 
- What would support these new core beliefs? 
- During the day, did I do anything, did anyone else behave or say something that fits this new belief?
- Alternatively, go out and test the new belief: 
  - What would happen if I did things that would support the new belief according to the old and the new belief? 
  - Try out the new belief (e.g. with strangers first) and write down and reflect on what happened - do your experiences support the new core beliefs? 

## Anxiety
The nervousness around experiences we are going to face. Generally, its thoughts around bad things happening and thinking we're not going to be able to cope: the danger we fear is larger than our confidence in our ability to cope. When anxious, we tend to avoid situations and places where we might feel uncomfortable or anxious which makes us even more anxious when we have to do it and it doesn't help actually fixing the problem. 

![Anxiety](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28791247/101259523-0dce3b80-3721-11eb-9473-2ce18a2003bf.png)

Anxious thoughts are often covered in What Ifs: “What if I stumble over my words? What if I forget my notes? What if peo- ple think I’m stupid and don’t know what I’m talking about?” These thoughts are future-oriented and predict danger or catastrophe. 

Anxiety often arises because we don’t have control over events. When we are anxious, we try to be in control or do things perfectly, in the hope that this will prevent bad things from happening. When we don't have confidence in our ability to cope, we lose control. The problem with this approach is that it is really impossible to do things perfectly or have complete control over what will happen in the future. Thus learning to boost our confidence that we can cope when things go wrong is a more helpful approach to managing anxiety than trying to prevent things from going wrong.

Other anxiety coping notes
- When you want to control things: do the opposite of trying to have control 
- Don’t expect anything. If there is an expectation there is anxiety and potential disappointment 
- Be able to detach from a situation and look at the situation from outside of yourself 
- If I want something, do the work today that lets me have it. No need to worry about it
- When overthinking, either become present and think of something else or refer to notes already written and possibly journal a bit
- Be much more aware of the insignificance of it all - we are here a small amount of time. Then we’re gone. Something can happen any moment that changes absolutely everything. Then what? Enjoy the time we have on this small world. The moment is all we have
- Shit does happen. We can wish things were different but we often just need to deal with reality and work with what we have left 
- To reduce worry, assume that what you fear the most is certainly going to happen

### Overcoming anxiety using Exposure
To overcome anxiety, we need to learn to approach the situations or people we avoid. Through these experiences, we have an opportunity to increase our confidence in our ability to cope with the situations that frighten us. 

A Fear Ladder can help with this: the top of the ladder is the most scary thing that needs to be done. Build up the ladder and do things such that you are ready to face your big fear when the time is there. You should expect that your anxiety will increase when you first begin to approach on your Fear Ladder. This is a good sign that you are facing your fears

A good technique is also visualization: perhaps visualize the event going well and the event going bad so that you're prepared for both. Use all senses when visualizing. Imagine what you will see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. It is also helpful to imagine what you might be thinking, feeling, and doing in the situation. 

### Managing anxiety
**Mindfullness and acceptance**
Most anxiety is about fears for the future. By being in the present moment, we don't think of the future and anxiety will decrease. Our mind will also not focus on the fears when we are in the present moment, which leads to a feeling of relaxation. Finally, one of the long-term benefits of mindfulness and acceptance is that they can help you tolerate and feel less anxiety, because you will learn to see your anxious thoughts as simply mental activity rather than as the truth. With practice, you can begin to understand your personal patterns of thinking and responding to events. You can learn that you don’t need to respond to your patterns of thinking and emotional reactions. Instead, you can simply observe them as they occur. People who practice mindfulness on a regular basis generally report greater feelings of calm, well-being, and acceptance of life’s difficulties.

**Breathing**
A related way to manage your anxiety is to practice balanced, deep breathing
Try breathing in to a slow count of 4 and out to a slow count of 4 for four minutes

**Progressive muscle relaxation**
“Progressive muscle relaxation” is a technique in which the major muscle groups in the body are alternately tensed and relaxed. The idea is to tense and then relax the muscles in the forehead, eyes, mouth and jaw, neck, shoulders, upper back, chest, biceps, forearms, hands, stomach, buttocks, groin, legs, thighs, calves, and feet. Each muscle group is tensed for 5 seconds and then relaxed for 10–15 seconds, then tensed again for 5 seconds and relaxed again for 10–15 seconds.

**Imagery** 
Imagery can be used to help you calm down before you enter a situation that is likely to make you feel anxious. Imagine a relaxing place and focus on how you feel - include as many senses as possible. 










ways: 
Exposure: doing the things you fear
Cognifitve restructuring: identifying and understanding unhelpful thoughts and for challenging and replacing our automatic thoughts. 

You have to identify the root of your performance anxiety. Are you worried that: You don’t know the material? You can’t answer a difficult question? Your presentation is boring? You don’t come off as expert? You look stupid? You sound unpolished? Your material doesn’t flow? Nobody will show up? People don’t understand you? The audience doesn’t care? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more. 

## Overcoming anxiety
- Separate yourself from your feelings and emotions. I am not anxiety. An anxious thought is a type of thought that can enter my brain but how I choose to respond to it and perceive it is what is going to define me.
- I’ve found it’s beneficial to learn to recognize the thought and try to just let it pass. “Oh, there went an anxious thought."
- Positive thinking is not a good solution as it doesn’t address the problem and doesn’t prepare us for the feelings we’ll feel in the moment (and we’d feel bad for feeling a certain way). A better solution is to anticipate our anxious feelings and have a plan on how to cope with them. 



  - Only engage in positive self talk. Recognize negative automatic thoughts and write it down or think about it - see CBT. 
    - Why do you believe that, what proof do you have?
    - Can it be you were mistaken or are basing this on a single or even just a few past experiences?
    - Do you past the same harsh judgment on other people in a similar situation or do you empathize with them instead? 
    - If this feeling is not true why act like is if there is no good reason to believe it.
    - Step aside of yourself and ask yourself what a good friend would tell you


- Think your fears though to their logical conclusion. Perfectionists often think catastrophically, ‘If i make a mistake in front of my colleagues then that will be the end of everything’, without really thinking through what ‘the end of everything’ would actually look like. Consider the worst possible outcome of your fear, then be honest with yourself about how likely that scenario actually is. Then you can start to consider how such an event would actually play out and how bad or not it would actually be.
