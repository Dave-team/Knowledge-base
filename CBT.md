# CBT 
## Fundamentals
Cognitive Behavorial Therapy is a form of psychotherapy. A central idea in CBT is that our thoughts about an event or experience powerfully affects our emotional, behavioral, and physical responses to it, often because we identify with the thoughts, we see them as real even though there are distorted and this leaves us in a bad mood.  
Once a mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen the mood. But when we feel intense moods, we are more likely to distort, discount, or disregard information that contradicts the validity of our moods and beliefs. In fact, the stronger our moods, the more extreme our thinking is likely to be. This is why it is helpful to be aware of our thoughts when we are most distressed. When we are aware of our thoughts, we more easily see how they are influencing our mood.

Once we invite negative thoughts through distortions, your feelings and actions will reinforce each other in a cycle. Because we believe what our brain tells us, we see the world as a dark place. Because if feels realistic, there is a lot of credibility that goes towards it. The cycle then goes on and you're trapped. Just as our thoughts affect our physical reactions, our physical reactions can trigger thoughts (e.g. different heartbeat can lead to think it’s a heart attack). 

To really heal, we shouldn't stop when we feel better. Instead, we'd want to actually get better: 
- Understand why we felt a certain way 
- Knowing why and how you got better. This involves a mastery of the particular self-help techniques that worked specifically for you so that you can reapply them and make them work again whenever you choose.
- Acquiring self-confidence and self-esteem. Self-confidence is based on the knowledge that you have a good chance of being reasonably successful in personal relationships and in your career. Self-esteem is the capacity to experience maximal self-love and joy whether or not you are successful at any point in your life.
- Locating the deeper problems that may have caused this all

My evaluation on this: 
- Why I became anxious: Break up that wasn't my choice and felt out of control. Lived on autopilot for a long time. 2 weeks at home thinking uncovered all my worries and fears that I previously escaped from. Let to panic attacks which further let me to believe I am out of control. This rolled into a general feeling of not being able to handle life. 
- What made me feel better: 
  - Understanding that the effects are natural. A panic attack is not the end of the world, it's a bodies reaction. 
  - Logging dysfunctional thoughts with their rational response. 
- Self confidence will come from me facing my fears and trusting in my inate abilities to figure things out and deal with hardship. 
- Self esteem comes from balancing my personality much more beyond work with hobbies and mindfulness 
- The deeper causes are rooted in perfectionism and achievement focus. Achievement because I identified my worth by my achievements rather than my holistic person. Perfectionism in wanting to do everything really well so I can happy with the work I did which would always need to be really great. At work, this is: if I'm not perfect, I won't progress my career. In life: discovering new hobbies and activities has been slow as I couldn't use to perfect myself towards achievement - what's the point? And I would want to be really good when I pick things up - otherwise I wouldn't enjoy it and didn't see the point. I wouldn't enjoy the process as I would race towards becoming very good that probably would take a lot of effort that I'd want to allocate elsewhere 'more productive'.

## General
- Your feelings and thoughts are not facts nor are they representative of your identity. Separate yourself from your feelings and emotions. I am not anxiety. An anxious thought is a type of thought that can enter my brain but how I choose to respond to it and perceive it is what is going to define me. Thoughts are often distorted and not the truth especially when stressed - do you really want to be influenced by these thoughts? 
- Be an objective observer of your thoughts and detach from a situation. Recognize the thought and try to just let it pass. “Oh, there went an anxious thought."
- What we are naturally good at/what our strengths are - controlling, organizing analyzing can also have an impact on how our mind functions because the mind also wants to control and analyze.
- When you want to control things: do the opposite of trying to have control and surrender
- Don’t expect anything. If there is an expectation there is anxiety and potential disappointment 
- At some point we’ll just be tired of worrying g and being anxious and then we just do things. Same as having a near death experience. You really only have these moments so make the most of them and all the things you fear are small in the face of having 6 months to live
- A lot of the time, our mind is telling us we 'should' do something. Where is that voice coming from? Should for whom? Why? What if we don't? It's easy to go into auto pilot. It is easy for us to go into autopilot and our thinking becomes very narrow. 
- When comparing events to what happened in the past, remember that any events in the past are context dependent and the current context is always changing. 
- When comparing ourselves to others, it doesn't matter what others do as long as we achieve what we set out to achieve ourselves in the first place. 
- Deal with anxiety 
  - Ride it out - it will pass
  - Question the thinking and break it down
  - Distract yourself / focus on e.g. learning something new
  - Deep breathing exercises 
  - Progressive muscle relaxations 
  - Exercise
  - Use the energy in a useful way 
  - When stressed, worried or anxious, think about and reach out to someone else
- To feel self importance, distress or anxiety should be seen in the face of how short our lives is 


## Dealing with things
**Accepting our thoughts**
We are human. We have feelings and thoughts will always pop up. Acceptance involves observing your thoughts, moods, and physical reactions without making judgments about them. Be curious rather than critical. Think about the bigger picture. What are the benefits of accepting this rather than being distressed? Are you focusing on only the negative parts of this experience and not recognizing other dimensions? Are there aspects to the situation that counterbalance the negative parts? If you can accept the parts that distress you, will you be able to enjoy or appreciate the rest of your experience more easily?

**Trust yourself**
Have confidence in yourself that you can handle things. You did it before. Trust our creative mechanism to perform good

**Surrender**
Most things are not in control. Surrender to whatever will happen and just enjoy the ride. Try not to have any expectations. Flow like water. Approach things with childlike curiosity. To make the process as easy as possible, don't think about it until you are experiencing it. Accept the pain for what it is and it'll be over before you know it.

**Learning experiences**
Every hard thing we do is a learning experience. Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. You approached the experience in a certain way. Then you evaluate how it went and you can be better next time. Have a growth mindset. It's a puzzle to solve which is exciting - it's an opportunity to learn and I am enthusiastic about figuring it out. Always keep a Beginner's Mind: If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.

**Remember positive experiences**
Remember the positive experiences when things turned out just fine and even if they brought their challenges, I experienced, I learned and survived. This too shall pass. 

**Mememto mori**
Be much more aware of the insignificance of it all - we are here a small amount of time. Then we’re gone. Something can happen any moment that changes absolutely everything. Then what? Enjoy the time we have on this small world. The moment is all we have

**Force calm mind confidence and happiness**
Dance, smile and remember that the world is an amazing place. Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state. Just take things easy.

**Deal with reality, build confidence and character**
Shit does happen. We can wish things were different but we often just need to deal with reality and work with what we have left. This is what defines us, helps build self confidence and character

**Ground yourself in the present moment**
Most anxiety is about fears for the future. By being in the present moment, we don't think of the future and anxiety will decrease. Our mind will also not focus on the fears when we are in the present moment, which leads to a feeling of relaxation. Finally, one of the long-term benefits of mindfulness and acceptance is that they can help you tolerate and feel less anxiety, because you will learn to see your anxious thoughts as simply mental activity rather than as the truth. With practice, you can begin to understand your personal patterns of thinking and responding to events. You can learn that you don’t need to respond to your patterns of thinking and emotional reactions. Instead, you can simply observe them as they occur. People who practice mindfulness on a regular basis generally report greater feelings of calm, well-being, and acceptance of life’s difficulties.

**Exposure**
As we do the things we fear / we don't like, we have an opportunity to increase our confidence in our ability to cope with the situations that frighten us. Notice fears, take them for what they are just do it. We know that fear will arise but we do the thing we're set out to do anyway. The important thing is to do set up for the things and deal with them as they arise rather than planning how to deal with them.

A Fear Ladder can help with this: the top of the ladder is the most scary thing that needs to be done. Build up the ladder and do things such that you are ready to face your big fear when the time is there. You should expect that your anxiety will increase when you first begin to approach on your Fear Ladder. This is a good sign that you are facing your fears

A good technique is also visualization: perhaps visualize the event going well and the event going bad so that you're prepared for both. Use all senses when visualizing. Imagine what you will see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. It is also helpful to imagine what you might be thinking, feeling, and doing in the situation. 

**Understanding root cause**
What makes you feel scared or anxious? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more.

**Do something else**
When struggling, it's easy to overthing and stay very fixated with tunnel vision on something you believe should be solved. Challenge the thoughts that you need to keep thinking about things to solve them. You’ll realize it doesn’t need to be like that. Make it an experiment and see how that turns out. 

**Complete a Thought Record**
When we feel a strong mood, complete a Thought Record to: 
- Make sense of your emotional reactions
- See the bigger picture and don't react with a narrow, purely negative and possibly distorted view
- Over time, it'll help you think more flexibly. Over time this can lead to easier control of moods and thoughts 
- By writing down a thought record, we likely decrease the perception of danger coming from our anxiety. Writing down our thinking helps us gain objectivity and stops us from taking our thoughts so seriously. 

**Visualization**
Excercise: imagine Yourself Coping
Imagine stressful situations in great detail. What is happening? What do you see and hear? What makes me feel stressed? As you visualize the physical reactions/moods etc. How do you feel? What are you thinking? What are you doing? Do you have body sensations? Now imagine putting your techniques into effect.
Spend several minutes imagining doing each step of your plan in detail. As you carry out each step in your imagination, pay attention to what you are doing, thinking, and feeling. How does this affect your mood? Thoughts? Behavior? Physical experience?
Based on this imagination exercise, how confident are you (low, medium, or high) that you feel better again if you start to feel a certain way? If your confidence level is high, then your plan is probably a good one. If you confidence in your plan is low, then you want to think about what else you can add to it that will boost your likelihood of managing future challenges. If you think the plan is a good one, but you lack confidence in your skills to carry it out, the best thing to do is to continue practicing the skills in your plan of action even when you are feeling well. Ideally, you want most of your relapse reduction skills to be fairly automatic when you are doing well, so that you can rely on them to help you if you begin to feel worse.

**Use techniques to cope**
Anticipating feelings that we fear and having a plan on how to cope with them. 

*When I start to race*
- Pause. Am I racing because I tell myself I should be doing something? And am I racing to escape doing other things that might even be more satisfying? Am I doing it because others do it? Is it because I have nothing else to do? 
- What is the end goal when the thing I'm racing towards is completed? Realise that nothing will ever be finished - if I finish something now, that's fine - but that'll just open up another box of things to do. 
- Of the other things I'm focusing on, what else could I do right now that is perhaps more mindful? Right this moment, what else do I really feel like doing - base this on curiosity and energy levels? Doing something else will reduce the importance of the thing you thought you 'should' be doing. 
- When I do decide to do something, timebox the activity to avoid doing nothing else. And then have other things lined up to do instead - it's crucial that I genuinely believe those other things to be beneficial and enjoyable, otherwise I'll disregard them as less important. 

*Visualizing perfect end solutions*
I race towards future solutions. It’s better to solve problems as they come up and start with the fundamental first steps executed well. The future often will present itself. 

*Dealing with uncertainty*
Anything that is uncertain: is there a way I can know? Are there steps I can take? If not, realise that life is a mystery and it'll unfold itself. If there are things I can do, focus on doing those. Accept the fact that I cannot know everything all the time. The more I realize this the more comfortable I'll be - it'll get rid of a lot of self imposed pressure. 

*Team meetings*
- I judge and label the work I’ve done as good or bad. However, what I’ve done isn’t good or bad. It’s simply a result of the effort I put in during that week. What myself and others think of that is a reflection of thoughts, understanding of the situation and our mood. What is 'good' to someone can be 'bad' to someone else. We should look at it from outside ourselves and not label it because there isn't anything to label because nobody can know. 
- Craving for validation when I did something good leads to tension as you’d want to keep this validation. Criticism means that someone is in a mood and has an opinion of me from what they know and think of me that needs addressing. They may be right, they may be wrong. All I know it’s the best thing to do to my knowledge and I tried working at it in the best way possible. If there's feedback or criticism on that, then that's helpful as am I open to learn rather than defensive to criticism. 
- It has literally never happened that anyone tapped me on the fingers - how likely is it to happen now? 
- I project that I know what others think. In reality, they don’t know what I’m talking about and just want to make sure things get done 
- I blow up my own importance. The business needs to run - without me, it would still run 
- I identify with my work - whether “I” am worthy is depending on how I perform at work. I can switch job and be the same person, the job really isn’t all there is to it. 
- I set really high expectations on my own work - quality of decision making, technical ability and speed. Why not be more realistic? Setting high expectations causes suffering as there will be tension to meet them. Others don’t put this expectation on me, they just want to see good progress and happy employees. And they trust we work on the highest impact thing - if something is hard and takes more time that’s okay if its worth it. Otherwise, timebox. 

*Dentist*
- Go to the dentist and simply deal with it.
- Dental health is important to me. If I need to be fixed, it's important to get done sooner rather than later. I'm grateful it's possible to get fixed by someone who is well suited to perform these actions.
- I don't know what will happen - I don't expect anything and I surrender. 
- I am confident that I can handle it based on previous experience. Pain is part of the process; if the pain is too much, I will tell the dentist to stop or ask for drugs. 
- This will pass eventually. 
- Distract myself with music (headphones during session), mindfullness breathing, muscle relaxation. The pain is just another sensation. Another option is to embrace any discomfort, loud noise, or pain. Non-judgmentally observe it and breathe deeply.

*Flying*
- I am aware that during a flight, I can strongly feel the movements. It’s a natural phenomenon that isn’t actually dangerous looking at the statistics. Turbulence is just a bumpy road - if in a train I wouldn’t feel as bad. Realize you’re not in control any more so just let it happen and try to comfort yourself. 
- From experience, it’ll be just fine / it will soon pass.

*Panic attack*
- Physically remove from situation - don't do what you were doing, and move
- Force some strong body senses that break current thought patters - e.g. hold ice cubes, bite in lemon 
- Further be strongly aware of senses that change thought patters: 5 things to see, hear, smell
- Flex your muscles in some part then others and be aware 

**Log my experiences as I do hard things**
This journal can help me next time I experience something challenging. And this helps gathering evidence of things going well. 

**Breathing**
A related way to manage your anxiety is to practice balanced, deep breathing
Try breathing in to a slow count of 4 and out to a slow count of 4 for four minutes

**Progressive muscle relaxation**
“Progressive muscle relaxation” is a technique in which the major muscle groups in the body are alternately tensed and relaxed. The idea is to tense and then relax the muscles in the forehead, eyes, mouth and jaw, neck, shoulders, upper back, chest, biceps, forearms, hands, stomach, buttocks, groin, legs, thighs, calves, and feet. Each muscle group is tensed for 5 seconds and then relaxed for 10–15 seconds, then tensed again for 5 seconds and relaxed again for 10–15 seconds.

**Imagine a relaxing place** 
Imagery can be used to help you calm down before you enter a situation that is likely to make you feel anxious. Imagine a relaxing place and focus on how you feel - include as many senses as possible. It's a form of meditation that teaches us to focus on pleasant images to replace negative or stressful ones. When we picture more peaceful things, such as strolling on the beach at sunset, our bodies and minds become calmer. Engaging all of our senses – smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight – can make us feel that we are actually there. As we connect fully with the peaceful image, our minds and bodies become calmer and we don’t feel as stressed. Inspiration for imagination: 
- Walk to the top of a mountain. Birds singing, the light dancing through the tree branches, the smell of pine, the greenness of the forest, and the cool breeze as it touches your skin
- Imagine being someone from a movie. Imagine how this person looks, the music playing in the background, and the feeling of courage in your chest.

## Anxiety
The nervousness around experiences we are going to face. Generally, its thoughts around bad things happening and thinking we're not going to be able to cope: the danger we fear is larger than our confidence in our ability to cope. When anxious, we tend to avoid situations and places where we might feel uncomfortable or anxious which makes us even more anxious when we have to do it and it doesn't help actually fixing the problem. 

![Anxiety](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28791247/101259523-0dce3b80-3721-11eb-9473-2ce18a2003bf.png)

Anxious thoughts are often covered in What Ifs: “What if I stumble over my words? What if I forget my notes? What if peo- ple think I’m stupid and don’t know what I’m talking about?” These thoughts are future-oriented and predict danger or catastrophe. 

Anxiety often arises because we don’t have control over events. When we are anxious, we try to be in control or do things perfectly, in the hope that this will prevent bad things from happening. Since we don’t have confidence that we can cope with the dangers that worry us, it makes sense that we try to prevent them. The problem with this approach is that it is really impossible to do things perfectly or have complete control over what will happen in the future. Thus learning to boost our confidence that we can cope when things go wrong is a more helpful approach to managing anxiety than trying to prevent things from going wrong.

Anxiety can be reduced either by decreasing your perception of danger or by increasing your confidence in your ability to cope with the things you fear. An important part of overcoming anxiety is learning to tolerate feeling anxious

Anxiety comes and it goes – don’t identify with it (“I” am not anxious – I just experience an anxious episode) – I just watch it. You’re perfectly happy for it to be there and move on with your life whilst it passes through and eventually disappears. The more we identify with it and fight it, the more power we give it and the harder it gets. Be willing to observe it (“here comes anxiety”) as it passes by. Let tension and anxiety take care of itself. Let whatever happens happen. People are always fixing things – even things we don’t or can’t understand. Most things really don’t need to be fixed – they need to be understood. 

## Burnout 
The exhaustion funnel helps explain burnout. The top of funnel contains nourishing activities. As we become more stressed, this is what we give up. More and more to what seems as 'more important' as these nourishing activities appear optional. At the end, all that is left is work and no replenishing activities making us extremely exhausted and unable to enjoy small things. 

To avoid this, keep a healthy amount of nourishing activities. What lifts your mood, energises you, makes you feel calm and centred? What increases your sense of actually being alive andpresent,rather than merely existing? These are nourishing activities. E.g. taking a bath, reading a book, going for a walk, being involved with hobby. And when we do need to other activities, be mindful when doing them. The old saying, ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’ contains more than a grain of truth.

## Stress and panic attacks
- The autonomic nervous consists of the 
  - Sympathetic nervous system. This gets activated when alertness and energy is required - i.e. facing danger. Increase heart beat, heavier breathing. This is the fight or flight state.
  - Parasympathetic nervous system is in rest, slows heartbeat. This is the rest state. 
- Stress (activation of the sympathetic nervour system) is often very helpfull. When we are in danger, stress allows us to perform at our best by providing our body with energy. 
- The sympathetic nervous system / the fight-or-flight response can be triggered by both real and imaginary threats. A real threat can be an incoming bus as a pedestrian. Imaginary can be the worry of not finding a partner. In both cases, this sytem is triggered and fear hormonos are released (primarily adrenaline), increasing the heart rate, breathing etc to provide us with the energy to deal with the situation. Just thinking stressful thoughts can cause our body to release stress hormones as it gets ready to face a threat. It’s hard to get out of the situation as the mind is trying to solve a problem and telling your mind that a problem needs to be solved even though there isn’t anything to solve. 
- When stress is released from thoughts, we notice the effect in our bodies. We can then worry about how the way we are feeling, causing a chain reaction that can result in a panic attack. 
- From this, secondary fears can also develop – fear of bodily sensations caused by anxiety – commonly referred to as fear of fear. The unpleasant bodily sensations of anxiety and panic can then be feared as much as, or even greater than, the situation or event that triggered the anxiety response.

## Thought record 
A Thought Record consists of: 
1. Situation: Who, What, When, Where
2. Moods
  - What did you feel? (moods are described in single words). See below for tips on recognizing moods.
  - Rate each mood (0-100%)
  - Any physical reactions caused by the mood? (Consider general changes in energy level, appetite, pain levels, and sleep, as well as occasional symptoms such as muscle tension, tiredness, rapid heartbeat, stomachaches, sweating, dizziness, and breathing difficulties.)
3. Automatic Thoughts 
  - What was going through your mind in the situation? Any thoughts, beliefs, images, memories and meanings attached to the situation. We often don’t plan/intend these thoughts, they just happen. See the list below for questions that help identify automatic thoughts. 
  - Are these distorted any way? Refer to the list of cognitive distortions below.
4. Evidence that supports the hot thought 
5. Evidence that does not support the hot thought. See below for tips
6. Alternative / Balanced Thoughts 
   - Write an alternative /objective / balanced thought. See below for tips around this
   - Rate how much you believe each thought 
7.	Rate moods now: Rate column 2 moods and any new moods 

**Notes around Thought Records**
- When you are down on yourself, you might find it helpful to ask what you actually mean when you try to define your true identity with a negative label such as “a fool,” ”a bad partner” etc. Once you begin to pick these destructive labels apart, you will find they are arbitrary and meaningless. They actually cloud the issue, creating confusion and despair. Once rid of them, you can define and cope with any real problems that exist.
- You do not try to cheer yourself up by rationalizing or saying things you do not believe are objectively valid. Instead, try to recognize the truth. If what you write down in the Rational Response column is not convincing and realistic, it won’t help you one bit. For example, in answer to “I never do anything right,” you could write, “Forget that! I do some things right and some wrong, just like everyone else. I fouled up on my appointment, but let’s not blow this up out of proportion.”
- Suppose you cannot think of a rational response to a particular negative thought. Then just forget about it for a few days and come back to it later. You will usually be able to see the other side of the coin. The more practice you get in thinking of rational responses to irrational thoughts, the easier this will become. 

**How to identify moods**
- Pay attention to the body: tightness, closed
- Do it more often: notice three different moods each day
- Think back at past situations and identify moods 
- Use the list at the end of this page for inspiration

**Questions to help Identify automatic thoughts**
-	What was going through my mind?
-	What images or memories do I have in this situation? 
-	What does this mean about me? My life? My future
-	What am I afraid might happen? 
-	What is the worst that could happen?
-	What does this mean about how the other person(s) feel(s)/think(s) about me? 
-	What does this mean about the other person(s) or people in general? 
-	Did I break rules, hurt others, or not do something I should have done? What do I think about myself that I did this or believe I did this? 

**Finding evidence**
Think of your automatic thoughts as hypotesis. Don't take them as truth and look at them for what they are - thoughts made up in my mind that are likely strongly enforced because of the mood I'm feeling 

-	Have I had any experiences or is there any information that suggests that this thought is not completely true all the time and maybe only happened a few times in the past and it went well other times?
-	If my best friend or someone I loved had this thought, what would I tell them?
-	If my best friend or someone who cares about me knew I was thinking this thought, what would they say to me? What factual evidence would they point out to me that suggests my hot thought is not 100% true?
-	Are there any small pieces of information that contradict my hot thought that I might be ignoring or discounting as not important?
-	Are there any strengths or qualities I have that I am ignoring? What are they? How might they help in this situation?
-	Are there any positives in this situation that I am ignoring? Is there any information that suggests there might be a positive outcome in this situation?
-	Have I been in this type of situation before? What happened? Is there anything different between this situation and previous ones? What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me understand this situation differently?
-	When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this type of situation any differently? How? What factual information do I focus on?
-	When I have felt this way in the past, what did I think about that helped me feel better?
-	Five years from now, if I look back at this situation, will I look at it any differently? Will I focus on any different part of my experience?
-	Am I jumping to any conclusions in columns 3 and 4 that are not completely justified by the facts? Do I have proof for the thoughts?
-	Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control? What facts can I write down that reflect a more fair, compassionate, or kind view of my responsibility?

**Questions to help arrive at alternative or Balanced thinking**
What you want to do is collect evidence in favor of the alternative thought until you believe it much more. Sometimes a little bit of additional information shifts our interpretation and understanding of a situation 180 degrees
-	Now that the evidence is considered, is there an alternative or balanced way of thinking about or understanding this situation? Often it's a combination of columns 4 and 5. 
-	To write a balanced thought, write one statement summarizing all the evidence that supports my hot thought(s) (column 4), and another statement summarizing all the evidence that does not sup- port my hot thought(s) (column 5). Does combining the two summary statements with the word “and” create a balanced thought that takes into account all the information I have gathered?
-	If someone I cared about was in this situation, had these thoughts, and had this information available, what alternative view(s) of the situation would I suggest?
-	If someone who cares about me knew I had my hot thought(s), what might this person say is another way of understanding this situation?
-	If a hot thought is supported, what is the worst outcome? If a hot thought is supported, what is the best outcome? If a hot thought is supported, what is the most likely outcome?

## Testing our assumptions
Often, anxiety is described as 'If...Then' statements. "If I speak - people will think X"

To overcome these assumptions, create experiments: 
-	Experiment: what experiment do I plan to do?
  - EXPERIMENT 1: DOES “THEN . . . ” ALWAYS FOLLOW “IF . . . ”?
  - EXPERIMENT 2: OBSERVE OTHERS AND SEE IF YOUR “IF . . . THEN . . . ” RULE APPLIES TO THEM
  - EXPERIMENT 3: DO THE OPPOSITE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
-	Prediction: what will happen based on my underlying assumptions? E.g. If I speak then I'll make a fool of myself. 
-	Possible problems: what problems might interfere with the experiment 
-	Strategies to overcome these problems: What is the plan to overcome these problems? 
-	Outcome of experiment: write down in detail what actually happens: 
  - What happened?
  - Do the outcomes match what you predicted?
  - Did anything unexpected happen?
  - If things didn’t turn out as you wanted, how well did you handle it?
-	What have I learned from this experiment about this assumption? 

## Challenging core beliefs 
Core beliefs are all-or-nothing statements about yourself, others, or the world. Identifying core beliefs by repeatedly asking yourself, “What does this mean about me?” E.g. I'm not interesting enough

Instead of testing our negative core beliefs, it is usually more helpful to identify new core beliefs that we would like to hold, and then look for evidence to support or strengthen these new core beliefs. 
- What would support these new core beliefs? 
- During the day, did I do anything, did anyone else behave or say something that fits this new belief?
- Alternatively, go out and test the new belief: 
  - What would happen if I did things that would support the new belief according to the old and the new belief? 
  - Try out the new belief (e.g. with strangers first) and write down and reflect on what happened - do your experiences support the new core beliefs? 

Other things that can help: 
- Sometimes a new core belief will include a perspective of acceptance. For example, you might choose to shift from a core belief of “People are unreliable” to one of “It is OK if people are unreliable, because I am capable and can handle it.”
- “Gratitude” means thinking about and being thankful for experiences or qualities in ourselves, other people, and the world. Start a gratitude journal that covers all this. It is more helpful to write about a few things in depth than to try to make a long list of things you are grateful for. As you practice more with gratitude, also considering mentioning what we’re grateful for to other people. 
- In addition to being grateful for the positives in our lives, another way to activate and support our new positive core beliefs is to do kind things for other people. Examples include opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend, smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs

## Vertical arrow technique 
Expose the silent assumption(s) that give rise to your automatic thoughts with the use of the vertical-arrow method. The downward arrow is a form of shorthand for the following questions: “If that thought were true, why would it upset me? What would it mean to me?” This process leads to a chain of automatic thoughts that will reveal the root cause of the problem. In the vertical-arrow method you imagine instead that your distorted automatic thought is absolutely valid, and you look for the grain of truth in it. This enables you to penetrate the core of your problems.
My boyfriend didn’t call me this weekend as he promised he would.
↓ “Why would that be upsetting to me? What does it mean to me?”

That means he’s neglecting me. That means he really doesn’t love me.
↓ “And suppose that were true. What would that mean to me?”

That would mean there’s something wrong with me. Otherwise he’d be more attentive.
↓“And suppose that were true. What would that mean to me?”

That would mean I was going to be rejected.
↓ “And if I were in fact rejected, what then? What would that mean to me?”

That would mean I was unlovable and I would always be rejected.  
↓“And if that happened, why would it upset me?”
That would mean I’d end up alone and miserable.”

## Vulnerabilities 
I am vulnerable for depression / anxiety on the achievement and perfectionism. 

The first step in changing any personal value is to determine if it works more to your advantage or disadvantage. Deciding that it will not really help you to measure your worth by what you produce is the crucial first step in changing your philosophy.

**Achievement**
Benefits: 
Your work ethic allows you to feel you’ve earned personal worth and the right to feel happy. This belief system may make you especially motivated to produce. You might put extra effort into your career because you’re convinced this will give you extra worthiness units, and you will therefore see yourself as a more desirable person. You can avoid the horrors of being “just average.” In a nutshell, you may work harder to win, and when you win you may like yourself better.

Disadvantages:
- First, if your business or career is going well, you may become so preoccupied with it that you may inadvertently cut yourself off from other potential sources of satisfaction and enjoyment as you slave away from early morning to late night. If it's not going well, you identify with it causing you to feel bad necessarily and give up on all satisfactionairy things in life as well.
- As you become more and more of a workaholic, you will feel excessively driven to produce because if you fail to keep up the pace, you will experience a severe withdrawal characterized by inner emptiness and despair. In the absence of achievement, you’ll feel worthless and bored because you’ll have no other basis for self-respect and fulfillment. The more we achieve, the higher we set the bar without an end in sight; the reason for this is that achievement does not guarantee happiness. Since your thoughts are the true key to your moods and not success, the thrill of victory fades quickly; we achieve something and then immediately move on to the next thing. And then when we're older, eventually these questions may confront you as well: What’s my life all about? What’s the meaning of it all? You may believe your success makes you worthwhile, but the promised payoff seems elusive, just beyond your grasp
- Suppose as a result of illness, business reversal, retirement, or some other factor beyond your control, you find you are unable to produce at the same high level for a period of time. Now you may pay the price of a severe depression, triggered by the conviction that because you are less productive it means you are no good. You’ll feel like a tin can that’s been used and is now ready for the trash.

Overcoming achievement vulnerabilities: 
- Most human beings are not great achievers, yet most people are happy and well respected. Similarly, some people have great success but aren't happy. Thus, it cannot be the case that happiness and love come only through great achievement
- If you insist your worth is determined by your achievement, you are creating a self-esteem equation: worth = achievement. What is the basis for making this equation? What objective proof do you have that it is valid? The whole idea is nonsense.
- Move away from the concept of 'worth'. Then you can focus on living in the here and now instead. What problems do you face in life? How will you deal with them? That’s where the action is, not in the elusive mirage of 'worth'. Rather than grasp for “worth,” aim for satisfaction, pleasure, learning, mastery, personal growth and communication with others every day of your life. Set realistic goals for yourself and work toward them. I think you will find this so abundantly gratifying you’ll forget all about “worth".
- Recognize that there is only one way you can lose a sense of self-worth—by persecuting yourself with unreasonable, illogical negative thoughts. Self-esteem can be defined as the state that exists when you are not arbitrarily haranguing and abusing yourself but choose to fight back against those automatic thoughts with meaningful rational responses. When you do this effectively, you will experience a natural sense of jubilation and self-endorsement. Essentially, you don’t have to get the river flowing, you just have to avoid damming it. This will help you realize that the problem is not your actual performance, but the critical way in which you put yourself down. As you learn to evaluate what you do realistically, you will experience increased satisfaction and self-acceptance.
- “Tune In to What Turns You On. One assumption which might be driving you to constant preoccupation with achievement is the idea that true happiness comes only through success in your career. This is unrealistic because the majority of life’s satisfactions do not require great achievement at all. It takes no special talent to enjoy an average walk through the woods on an autumn day. You don’t have to be “outstanding” to relish the affectionate hug of your young son. You can enjoy a good game of volley ball tremendously even though you’re just an average player. What are some of life’s pleasures that have turned you on? Music? Hiking? Swimming? Food? Travel? Conversation? Reading? Learning? Sports? Sex? You don’t have to be famous or a top performer to enjoy these to the hilt. Use the Pleasure-Predicting Sheet: Each day he agreed to schedule various activities that might give him a sense of pleasure, satisfaction, or personal growth. These activities could be related to his consulting business as well as hobbies and recreational pursuits. Before each activity he was to write down his prediction of how enjoyable it would be and mark it between 0 percent (no satisfaction at all) and 99 percent (the maximum enjoyment a human being can experience). You'll find that life beyond work also holds great resources for satisfaction

**Perfection**
“Perfection” is man’s ultimate illusion. It simply doesn’t exist in the universe. There is no perfection. It’s really the world’s greatest con game; it promises riches and delivers misery. The harder you strive for perfection, the worse your disappointment will become because it’s only an abstraction, a concept that doesn’t fit reality. Everything can be improved if you look at it closely and critically enough—every person, every idea, every work of art, every experience, everything. So if you are a perfectionist, you are guaranteed to be a loser in whatever you do.

Overcoming perfection: 
- Understand pros and cons. 
  - Pros: 
    - feeling that something is done to the best of your abilility which results in great work
    - once you know 'everything' you can set out to achieve a great many things 
  - Cons:
    - The anxiety and tension actually moves away from achieving great work
    - Spending enormous time for little benefit (80/20) 
    - Probably never be satisfied with your work and never celebrating achievement 
    - Very self critical
    - Missing out on lots of other enjoyable things in life 
    - Afraid of risking things as they'd need to be perfect. This keeps us from trying new things and making new discoveries. 
- Put your assumptions to the test. Do you need to do things perfectly? Did you ever think that maybe you’ve been as successful as you are in spite of your perfectionism and not because of it? Try altering your standards in various activities so you can see how your performance responds to high standards, middle standards, and low standards. By lowering my standards not only do I feel better about what I do but I tend to do it more effectively. Dare to aim at being average! It takes courage, but you may amaze yourself
- Face your fears. Fear is the fuel that drives your compulsion to polish things to the ultimate. If you choose to give up your perfectionism, you may initially have to confront this fear. Are you willing? There is, after all, a payoff in perfectionism—it protects you. It may protect you from risking criticism, failure, or disapproval. If you decide to start doing things less perfectly, at first you may feel as shaky as if a big California earthquake were about to hit”  The moment they try to stop what they are doing, they are gripped by a powerful uneasiness that rapidly escalates to raw terror. This drives them back to their compulsive ritual in a pathetic attempt to find relief. One method of confronting and conquering this fear is called “response prevention.” The basic principle is simple and obvious. You refuse to give in to the perfectionistic habit, and you allow yourself to become flooded with fear and discomfort. Stubbornly stick it out and do not give in no matter how upset you become. Hang in there and allow your upset to reach its maximum. Rather than run from your fear, sit still and confront the bogeyman! Ask yourself, “What am I afraid of?” “What’s the worst that could happen?” Then write down your automatic thoughts, and call their bluff. It will be frightening, but if you tough it out and endure the discomfort, you will conquer your fears because they are ultimately based on illusions.
- Benefit from mistakes and faillures. How can you benefit from an actual failure? It’s simple! You remind yourself that your life won’t be destroyed. Getting a B, in fact, is one of the best things that can happen to you if you are a straight A student because it will force you to confront and accept your humanness. The real tragedy occurs when a student is so bright and compulsive that he or she successfully wards off any chance of failure through overwhelming personal effort, and ends up graduating with a perfect straight A average. The paradox in this situation is that success has a dangerous effect of turning these students into cripples or slaves whose lives become obsessively rigid attempts to ward off the fear of being less than perfect. Their careers are rich in achievement but frequently impoverished in joy.
- Focus on process rather than outcome. Do your preparation and practice to the best of your ability but understand that the outcome is out of my control.
- Another way to overcome perfectionism involves assuming responsibility for your life by setting strict time limits on all your activities for one week. This will help you change your perspective so you can focus on the flow of life and enjoy it. If you are a perfectionist, you are probably a real procrastinator because you insist on doing things so thoroughly. The secret to happiness is to set modest goals to accomplish them. If you would like to change, then as you schedule your day in the morning, decide on the amount of time you will budget on each activity. Quit at the end of the time you have set aside whether or not you have completed it, and go onto the next project. If you play the piano and tend to play for many hours or not at all, decide instead to play only an hour a day. I think you’ll enhance your satisfaction and output substantially this way. 
- In your perfectionism you are undoubtedly great at focusing on all the ways you fall short. You have the bad habit of picking out the things you haven’t done and ignoring those you have. You spend your life cataloging every mistake and shortcoming. No wonder you feel inadequate! Is somebody forcing you to do this? Do you like feeling that way? Focus on positives and achievements instead.
- The next method to combat perfectionism involves personal disclosure. If you feel nervous or inadequate in a situation, then share it with people. Point out the things you feel you’ve done inadequately instead of covering them up. Ask people for suggestions on how to improve, and if they’re going to reject you for being imperfect, let them do it and get it over with. If in doubt as to where you stand, ask if they think less of you when you make a mistake. Asserting your right to make mistakes will paradoxically make you a greater human being. If the other person feels disappointed, the fault is really his for having set up the unrealistic expectation you are more than human.
- The next method is to focus mentally on a time in your life when you were really happy. What image comes to mind? Often go back into that situation and mindset when you feel like it could benefit you.  
- Know when to move on. Suppose you have a task and you notice you’re moving slowly. You may find that you’ve already reached the point of diminishing returns, and you’d do better by moving on to the next task. I’m not advocating that you slough off, but you may find that you as well as others will be equally if not more pleased with many good, solid performances than with one stress-producing masterpiece
- Simply realize we are human and humans make mistakes. And then ask What can I learn from my mistake? Is there some good that could come from this? You may even go so far as to say your imperfections and goof-ups are some of your greatest assets. Cherish them! Never give up your capacity for being wrong because then you lose the ability to move forward. In fact, just think what it would be like if you were perfect. There’d be nothing to learn, no way to improve, and life would be completely void of challenge and the satisfaction that comes from mastering something that takes effort. It would be like going to kindergarten for the rest of your life. You’d know all the answers and win every game. Every project would be a guaranteed success

Why It’s Great to Be Able to Make Mistakes
1. I fear making mistakes because I see everything in absolutist, perfectionistic terms—one mistake and the whole is ruined. This is erroneous. A small mistake certainly doesn’t ruin an otherwise fine whole.
2. It’s good to make mistakes because then we learn—in fact, we won’t learn unless we make mistakes. No one can avoid making mistakes—and since it’s going to happen in any case, we may as well accept it and learn from it.
3. Recognizing our mistakes helps us to adjust our behavior so that we can get results we’re more pleased with—so we might say that mistakes ultimately operate to make us happier and make things better.
4. If we fear making mistakes, we become paralyzed—we’re afraid to do or try anything, since we might (in fact, probably will) make some mistakes. If we restrict our activities so that we won’t make mistakes, then we are really defeating ourselves. The more we try and the more mistakes we make, the faster we’ll learn and the happier we’ll be ultimately.
5. Most people aren’t going to be mad at us or dislike us because “we make mistakes—they all make mistakes, and most people feel uncomfortable around “perfect” people.
6. We don’t die if we make mistakes.

## Cognitive distortions summary
1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see things in black-and-white categories.If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
2. OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single negative event as a never- ending pattern of defeat.
3. MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that colors the entire beaker of water.
4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject positive experiences by insisting they "don't count for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.
5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.
   1. Mindreading. You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out. 
   2. The Fortune Teller Error.You anticipate that things will turnout badly,and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already established fact.
6. MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else's achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).This is also called the "binoculartrick."
7. EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: "I feel it, therefore it must be true."
8. SHOULDSTATEMENTS: You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts,as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. "Musts" and "oughts" are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.
9. LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization.Instead of describing your error,you attach a negative label to yourself: "I'm a loser."When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: "He's a goddam louse." Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.
10. PERSONALIZATION: You see yourself as me cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.

## Cognitive distortions
Cognitive distortions are simply ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn’t really true. These inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions — telling ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling bad about ourselves. The more strong our emotions, the more twisted our thinking becomes. 

Example: “For example, let’s take a look at Art’s thoughts. His panic was the result of his catastrophic interpretation: “This criticism shows how worthless I am.” What mental errors is he making? In the first place, Art is jumping to conclusions when he arbitrarily concludes the patient’s criticism is valid and reasonable. This may or may not be the case. Furthermore, he is exaggerating the importance of whatever he actually said to the patient that may have been undiplomatic (magnification), and he is assuming he could do nothing to correct any errors in his behavior (the fortune teller error). He unrealistically predicted he would be rejected and ruined professionally because he would repeat endlessly whatever error he made with this one patient (overgeneralization). He focused exclusively on his error (the mental filter) and over-looked his numerous other therapeutic successes (disqualifying or overlooking the positive). He identified with his erroneous behavior and concluded he was a “worthless and insensitive human being” (labeling).”

**Filtering**
A person engaging in filter (or “mental filtering) takes the negative details and magnifies those details while filtering out all positive aspects of a situation. For instance, a person may pick out a single, unpleasant detail and dwell on it exclusively so that their vision of reality becomes darkened or distorted. When a cognitive filter is applied, the person sees only the negative and ignores anything positive. E.g. someone picks on a friend - the world is cruel! Event though before and after nobody picks on her. Or when a student misses a few questions in the exam and is sure to flunk (meanwhile she had all other answers correct). 

**Disqualifying the positive**
Transforming neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones. When receiving a compliment - 'they don't really mean that - they're just being nice'. Or an accomplishment at work: 'og it was nothign really'. If you always throw cold water on the good things that happen, life is quite dark. 

Instead, make life richer and apprectiate compliments, say thank you and celebrate when you did something well. 

**Polarized Thinking (or “Black and White” Thinking)**
In polarized thinking, things are either “black-or-white” — all or nothing. We have to be perfect or we’re a complete and abject failure — there is no middle ground. A person with polarized thinking places people or situations in “either/or” categories, with no shades of gray or allowing for the complexity of most people and most situations. A person with black-and-white thinking sees things only in extremes. “Because I lost the race for governor, I’m a zero.”A straight - A student who received a B on an exam concluded,“Now I’m a total failure.”

All-or-nothing thinking forms the basis for perfectionism. It causes you to fear any mistake or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless.

Absolutes do not exist in this universe. If you try to force your experiences into absolute categories, you will be constantly depressed because your perceptions will not conform to reality. 

**Overgeneralization**
In this cognitive distortion, a person comes to a general conclusion based on a single incident or a single piece of evidence. If something bad happens just once, they expect it to happen over and over again. A person may see a single, unpleasant event as part of a never-ending pattern of defeat.

For instance, if a student gets a poor grade on one paper in one semester, they conclude they are a horrible student and should quit school. A boy who gets rejected by a girl feels as if nobody would ever want to date him, that all girls have identical tastes and he'll be lonely forever. 

**Jumping to Conclusions**
You arbitrarily jump to a negative conclusion that is not justified by the facts of the situation. Two version: mind reading and fortune telling. 

Mind reading: 
Without individuals saying so, a person who jumps to conclusions knows what another person is feeling and thinking — and exactly why they act the way they do. In particular, a person is able to determine how others are feeling toward the person, as though they could read their mind. And often this thinking is around others looking down on them. E.g. someone in the audience yawns or leaves and you think "This audience thinks I'm a bore". In fact, this person didn't sleep last night. A friend on the street doesn't say hello because he was trapped in thoughts: 'he is ignoring me so he musn't like me anymore. Your spouse is silent because her boss said something at work. You think 'she is mad at me. What did I do wrong?'

Fortune-telling - as if you have a crystal ball that also predicts misery for you. You expect something bad is about to happen and you take this as a fact, even though it's unrealistic. A panic attack leads us to pass out or go crazy even though these things never happened. Or "I am convinced that this anxiety will last forever and I'm doomed. And no treatment can help me.' 

For example, a person may conclude that someone is holding a grudge against them, but doesn’t actually bother to find out if they are correct. Another example involving fortune-telling is when a person may anticipate that things will turn out badly in their next relationship, and will feel convinced that their prediction is already an established fact, so why bother dating.

Or you text/call a friend and when they don't call back soon, you think they were not interested enough to reply. Then you avoid them as well only to later find out something happened that caused them to not receive the message. 

Instead, see the positive. 

**Catastrophizing**
When a person engages in catastrophizing, they expect disaster to strike, no matter what. This is also referred to as magnifying, and can also come out in its opposite behavior, minimizing. In this distortion, a person hears about a problem and uses what if questions (e.g., “What if tragedy strikes?” “What if it happens to me?”) to imagine the absolute worst occurring.

Magnification commonly occurs when you look at your own errors, fears, or imperfections and exaggerate their importance: “My God—I made a mistake. How terrible! How awful! The word will spreadlike wildfire! My reputation is ruined!”

For example, a person might exaggerate the importance of insignificant events (such as their mistake, or someone else’s achievement). Or they may inappropriately shrink the magnitude of significant events until they appear tiny (for example, a person’s own desirable qualities or someone else’s imperfections). Minimization is also when we think about our strengths and see them as small and unimportant. 

**Personalization**
This is the mother of guilt. You assume responsibility for a negative event even where there is no basis for doing so. 
Personalization is a distortion where a person believes that everything others do or say is some kind of direct, personal reaction to them. They literally take virtually everything personally, even when something is not meant in that way. A person who experiences this kind of thinking will also compare themselves to others, trying to determine who is smarter, better looking, etc.

A person engaging in personalization may also see themselves as the cause of some unhealthy external event that they were not responsible for. For example, “We were late to the dinner party and caused everyone to have a terrible time. If I had only pushed my husband to leave on time, this wouldn’t have happened.”

**Control Fallacies**
This distortion involves two different but related beliefs about being in complete control of every situation in a person’s life. In the first, if we feel externally controlled, we see ourselves as helpless a victim of fate. For example, “I can’t help it if the quality of the work is poor, my boss demanded I work overtime on it.”

The fallacy of internal control has us assuming responsibility for the pain and happiness of everyone around us. For example, “Why aren’t you happy? Is it because of something I did?”

**Emotional Reasoning**
The distortion of emotional reasoning can be summed up by the statement, “If I feel that way, it must be true.” Whatever a person is feeling is believed to be true automatically and unconditionally. If a person feels stupid and boring, then they must be stupid and boring.

Emotions are extremely strong in people, and can overrule our rational thoughts and reasoning. Emotional reasoning is when a person’s emotions takes over our thinking entirely, blotting out all rationality and logic. The person who engages in emotional reasoning assumes that their unhealthy emotions reflect the way things really are — “I feel it, therefore it must be true." It doesn't occur to us to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create the feelings. 

Realize that your feelings do not determine your worth, simply your relative state of comfort or discomfort. Rotten, miserable internal states do not prove that you are a rotten, worthless person, merely that you think you are; because you are in a temporarily depressed mood, you are thinking illogically and unreasonably about yourself.

**Shoulds**
Should statements (“I should pick up after myself more…”, "I must do that") appear as a list of ironclad rules about how every person should behave. People who break the rules make a person following these should statements angry. They also feel guilty when they violate their own rules. A person may often believe they are trying to motivate themselves with shoulds and shouldn’ts, as if they have to be punished before they can do anything. These statements cause you to feel pressured and resentful. 

For example, “I really should exercise. I shouldn’t be so lazy.” Musts and oughts are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When a person directs should statements toward others, they often feel anger, frustration and resentment. Paradoxically you end up feeling apathetic and unmotivated.

Should statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn’ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people falls short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you’ll feel bitter and self-righteous.You’ll either have to change your expectations to approximate reality or always feel let down by human behavior.

**Fallacy of Fairness**
In the fallacy of fairness, a person feels resentful because they think that they know what is fair, but other people won’t agree with them. As our parents tell us when we’re growing up and something doesn’t go our way, “Life isn’t always fair.” People who go through life applying a measuring ruler against every situation judging its “fairness” will often feel resentful, angry, and even hopelessness because of it. Because life isn’t fair — things will not always work out in a person’s favor, even when they should.

**Blaming**
When a person engages in blaming, they hold other people responsible for their emotional pain. They may also take the opposite track and instead blame themselves for every problem — even those clearly outside their own control.

For example, “Stop making me feel bad about myself!” Nobody can “make” us feel any particular way — only we have control over our own emotions and emotional reactions.

**Fallacy of Change**
In the fallacy of change, a person expects that other people will change to suit them if they just pressure or cajole them enough. A person needs to change people because their hopes for success and happiness seem to depend entirely on them.

This distortion is often found in thinking around relationships. For example, a girlfriend who tries to get her boyfriend to improve his appearance and manners, in the belief that this boyfriend is perfect in every other way and will make them happy if they only changed these few minor things.

**Labeling**
In labeling, a person generalizes one or two qualities into a negative global judgment about themselves or another person. This is an extreme form of overgeneralizing. Instead of describing an error in context of a specific situation, a person will attach an unhealthy universal label to themselves or others.

For example, they may say, “I’m a loser” in a situation where they failed at a specific task instead of 'I made a mistake'. When someone else’s behavior rubs a person the wrong way — without bothering to understand any context around why — they may attach an unhealthy label to him, such as “He’s a real jerk.”

When you label other people, you will invariably generate hostility. A common example is the boss who sees his occasionally irritable secretary as
“an uncooperative bitch.” She then sees his as bad and around it goes, focusing on one another's weakness or imperfection as proof of the other's worthlessness. 

Labeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river than a statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels—they are overly simplistic and wrong. Would you think of yourself exclusively as an “eater” just because you eat, or a “breather” just because you breathe? This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.

Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded. For example, instead of saying someone drops her children off at daycare every day, a person who is mislabeling might say that “She abandons her children to strangers.” Or when you're on a diet and eat ice cream and label yourself as a pig. 

To avoid labelling: 
How can this be accomplished? You must first consider that a human life is an ongoing process that involves a constantly changing physical body as well as an enormous number of rapidly changing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Your life therefore is an evolving experience, a continual flow. You are not a thing; that’s why any label is constricting, highly inaccurate, and global.

**Always Being Right**
When a person engages in this distortion, they are continually putting other people on trial to prove that their own opinions and actions are the absolute correct ones. To a person engaging in “always being right,” being wrong is unthinkable — they will go to any length to demonstrate their rightness.

For example, “I don’t care how badly arguing with me makes you feel, I’m going to win this argument no matter what because I’m right.” Being right often is more important than the feelings of others around a person who engages in this cognitive distortion, even loved ones.

**Heaven’s Reward Fallacy**
The final cognitive distortion is the false belief that a person’s sacrifice and self-denial will eventually pay off, as if some global force is keeping score. This is a riff on the fallacy of fairness, because in a fair world, the people who work the hardest will get the largest reward. A person who sacrifices and works hard but doesn’t experience the expected pay off will usually feel bitter when the reward doesn’t come.

## How to fix cognitive distortions
**Identify the Cognitive Distortion**
The most important step of fixing any problem in your life is identifying exactly what the problem is and how extensive it is in your life. You do this by creating a list of the troublesome thoughts throughout the day, as you’re having them. This process allows you to think about each problem or predicament in a more natural or realistic manner.

**Examine the Evidence**
The next step is to remove yourself from the emotionality of the upsetting event or episode of irrational thinking in order to examine the evidence more objectively. A thorough examination of an experience allows you to identify the basis for your distorted thoughts. If you are overly self-critical, you should identify a number of experiences and situations where you had success.

One effective method for examining the evidence is to look at individual thoughts connected to the event, and objectively decide whether those statements reflect an opinion or stone cold fact. For example, statements such as “I’m selfish” and “There’s something wrong with me” are opinions. “My co-worker spoke in angry voice toward me” and “I forgot to take out the trash” are facts. Segregating facts from opinions can help you determine which are likely to be a component of a cognitive distortion (the opinions) and therefore need your focus and efforts to undo.

**Double Standard Method**
An alternative to “self-talk” that is harsh and demeaning is to talk to ourselves in the same compassionate and caring way that we would talk with a friend in a similar situation. We are frequently much harder on ourselves than the people we care about in our lives, whether it be a friend or family member. We would never think of speaking to a close friend in the way we speak to ourselves in our own mind.

Instead of treating yourself with a different standard than what you hold everyone else to, why not use one single standard for everyone including yourself? Isn’t that more fair than using a double-standard? Give yourself the same encouragement that you would a trusted friend.

Imagine studying for an exam and telling a friend, “You’re going to screw this up, just like you screw everything else up!” Yet these are the same kinds of thoughts that run through many students’ minds before an exam. Can you answer such automatic, negative thoughts back with a rational response? For example, “You’re going to do well on this exam, I just know it. You studied hard for it and did your best to memorize the material. I believe in you.”

**Thinking in Shades of Gray**
Learning to undo black-and-white (or polarized) thinking can be challenging, because our minds take cognitive shortcuts to simplify processing of stimuli in order to hurry our ability to make a decision or choose a response. Black-and-white thinking can sometimes serve a good purpose, but it often leads a person down a path of irrational belief too.

Instead of thinking about a problem or predicament in an either-or polarity, thinking in shades of gray requires us to evaluate things on a scale of 0 through 100. When a plan or goal is not fully realized, think about and evaluate the experience as a partial success on this kind of scale.

For example, someone might think, “You can’t do anything right. You just blew your diet by having that second bite of ice cream.” What is the likelihood that a person’s entire dieting routine — that they’ve been following rigorously for months — is now made worthless by a single additional bite of ice cream? On our scale of 0 through 100, it might be about 1 percent likelihood.

**Experimental Method**
For example, let’s say you’ve been putting off organizing your digital photos because it’ll be “too hard” or “I just can’t do it.” What if the task was broken down into smaller parts, such as tackling just a single month at a time in one sitting? Is the thought that it’s just “too hard” still true, now that you’ve broken the task into smaller, attainable components?

In another example, imagine a person who believes over time that she is no longer liked by her friends because they never connect with her on social media or call. Could that person test whether it was true that her friends no longer like her? What if she reached out to them and asked them out to lunch or for drinks one day? While it’s not likely all of her friends will accept an invitation, it’s likely at least one or two of them will, providing clear evidence in support of the fact that her friends still like her.

**Survey Method**
Similar to the experimental method, the survey method is focused on asking others in a similar situation about their experiences to determine how irrational our thoughts might be. Using this method, a person seeks the opinions of others regarding whether their thoughts and attitudes are realistic.

For example, a person might believe, “Romantic partners should never fight. And if they do fight, they should never go to bed angry at one another.” Who could they survey to see whether this is true or not? A few friends who appear to be in happy relationships might be a good start. That person would soon realize that all couples fight, and while it may be a good idea not to go to bed angry, plenty of people do and their relationship is just fine despite that.

If you want to double-check on the rationality of your thought, check in with a few trusted friends to see what their opinions and experiences are.

**The Semantic Method**
When a person engages in a series of should statements (“I should do this” or “I shouldn’t do that”), they are applying a set of unwritten rules to their behavior that may make little sense to others. Should statements imply a judgment about your or another person’s behavior — one that may be unhelpful and even hurtful.

Every time you find yourself using a should statement, try substituting “It would be nice if…” instead. This semantic difference can work wonders in your own mind, as you stop “should-ing” yourself to death and start looking at the world in a different, more positive manner. Shoulds make a person feel bad and guilty about themselves. “Wouldn’t it be nice and more healthy if I started watching what I ate more?” puts the thought into a more curious, inquisitive phrasing — one where the answer might be yes, but might also be no (for instance, if you’ve just started cancer treatment, now’s not a good time to change your eating habits).

**Definitions**
For people who are more intellectual and like to argue about minutiae, this method of arguing with your cognitive distortions might come in handy. What does it mean to define ourselves as “inferior,” “a loser,” “a fool,” or “abnormal.” An examination of these and other global labels may reveal that they more closely represent specific behaviors, or an identifiable behavior pattern, instead of the total person.

When a person starts delving into the definition of a label and asking questions about those definitions, the results can be surprising. For instance, what it does it mean to think of yourself as “inferior”? Inferior to who? Others at your workplace? What are their specific work experiences and backgrounds? Aren’t they all inferior to someone else too? The more questions you ask when challenging a definition or label, the more you may come to realize the uselessness of such labels — especially when applied to ourselves.

**Re-attribution**
In personalization and blaming cognitive distortions, a person will point the finger to themselves for all of the negative things they experience, no matter what the actual cause.

In re-attribution, a person identifies external factors and other individuals that contributed to the problem or event. Regardless of the degree of responsibility a person assumes, a person’s energy is best utilized in the pursuit of resolutions to problems or identifying ways to cope with predicaments. By assigning responsibility accordingly, you’re not trying to deflect blame, but ensure you’re not blaming yourself entirely for something that wasn’t entirely your fault.

For example, if a project at work failed to get done on time and you were one of the members of the 5-member team, you’re one-fifth to blame for the project missing its deadline. From an objective perspective, you are not entirely to blame for the missed deadline.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**
This method for answering an irrational belief relies on motivation rather than facts to help a person undo the cognitive distortion. In this technique, it is helpful to list the advantages and disadvantages of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. A cost-benefit analysis will help to figure out what a person is gaining from feeling bad, distorted thinking, and inappropriate behavior.

“How will it help me to believe this negative, irrational thought, and how will it hurt me?” If you find the disadvantages of believing a thought outweigh the advantages, you’ll find it easier to talk back and refute the irrational belief.

## Procrastination / DoNothingism
Motivation doesn't come out of the blue. It often requires action in order to get motivated. Then you get motivated and you can start to flow. Don't wait until you're in the mood for something. Because you don't feel like doing things, you put it off and you can wait forever. Do you know why virtually any meaningful activity has a decent chance of brightening your mood? If you do nothing, you will become preoccupied with the flood of negative, destructive thoughts. If you do something, you will be temporarily distracted from that internal dialogue of self-denigration. What is even more important, the sense of mastery you will experience will disprove many of the distorted thoughts that slowed you down in the first place.

Mindsets associated with procrastination: 

**Hopelessness**
When you are depressed, you get so frozen in the pain of the present moment that you forget entirely that you ever felt better in the past and find it inconceivable that you might feel more positive in the future. Therefore, any activity will seem pointless because you are absolutely certain your lack of motivation and sense of oppression are unending and irreversible.

**Overwhelming Yourself**
There are several ways you may overwhelm yourself into doing nothing. You may magnify a task to the degree that it seems impossible to tackle. You may assume you must do everything at once instead of breaking each job down into small, discrete, manageable units which you can complete one step at a time. 

**Helplessness**
You can’t possibly do anything that will make yourself feel better because you are convinced that your moods are caused by factors beyond your control, such as fate, hormone cycles, dietary factors, luck, and other people’s evaluations of you.

**Jumping to Conclusions**
You sense that it’s not within your power to take effective action that will result in satisfaction because you are in the habit of saying, “I can’t,” or “I would but …” Thus when I suggested that a depressed woman bake an apple pie, she responded, “I can’t cook anymore.” What she really meant to say was, “I have the feeling I wouldn’t enjoy cooking and it seems like it would be awfully difficult.” When she tested these assumptions by attempting to bake a pie, she found it surprisingly satisfying and not at all difficult.

**Self-labeling**
The more you procrastinate, the more you condemn yourself as inferior. This saps your self-confidence further. The problem is compounded when you label yourself “a procrastinator” or “a lazy person.” This  “causes you to see your lack of effective action as the “real you” so that you automatically expect little or nothing from yourself.

**Undervaluing the Rewards**
When you are depressed you may fail to initiate any meaningful activity not only because you conceive of any task as terribly difficult, but also because you feel the reward simply wouldn’t be worth the effort.
“Anhedonia” is the technical name for a diminished ability to experience satisfaction and pleasure. A common thinking error—your tendency to “disqualify the positive”—may be at the root of this problem. His lack of satisfaction results from the fact that he always finds a way to discredit his efforts. His bad habit of saying “It doesn’t count” successfully torpedoes any sense of fulfillment.

**Perfectionism**
You defeat yourself with inappropriate goals and standards. You will settle for nothing short of a magnificent performance in anything you do, so you frequently end up having to settle for just that—nothing.

**Fear of Failure**
Another mind-set which paralyzes you is the fear of failure. Because you imagine that putting in the effort and not succeeding would be an overwhelming personal defeat, you refuse to try at all. Several thinking errors are involved in the fear of failure. One of the most common is overgeneralization. You reason, “If I fail at this, it means I will fail at anything.

**Fear of Success**
Because of your lack of confidence, success may seem even more risky than failure because you are certain it is based on chance. Therefore, you are convinced you couldn’t keep it up, and you feel your accomplishments will falsely raise the expectations of others. “You may also fear success because you anticipate that people will make even greater demands on you.

**Fear of Disapproval or Criticism**
You imagine that if you try something new, any mistake or flub will be met with strong disapproval and criticism because the people you care about won’t accept you if you are human and imperfect. The risk of rejection seems so dangerous that to protect yourself you adopt as low a profile as possible. If you don’t make any effort, you can’t goof up!

**Coercion and Resentment**
A deadly enemy of motivation is a sense of coercion. You feel under intense pressure to perform—generated from within and without. This happens when you try to motivate yourself with moralistic “shoulds” and “oughts.” You tell yourself, “I should do this” and “I have to do that.” Then you feel obliged, burdened, tense, resentful, and guilty. You feel like a delinquent child under the discipline of a tyrannical probation officer. Every task becomes colored with such unpleasantness that you can’t stand to face it. Then as you procrastinate, you condemn yourself as a lazy, no-good bum. This further drains your energies

**Low Frustration Tolerance**
You assume that you should be able to solve your problems and reach your goals rapidly and easily, so you go into a frenzied state of panic and rage when life presents you with obstacles. Rather than persist patiently over a period of time, you may retaliate “against the “unfairness” of it all when things get tough, so you give up completely. I also call this the “entitlement syndrome” because you feel and act as if you were entitled to success, love, approval, perfect health, happiness, etc.” “Your frustration results from your habit of comparing reality with an ideal in your head. When the two don’t match, you condemn reality. It doesn’t occur to you that it might be infinitely easier simply to change your expectations than to bend and twist reality.

**Guilt and Self-blame**
If you are frozen in the conviction you are bad or have let others down, you will naturally feel unmotivated to pursue your daily life.”

## Overcoming procrastination

## Therapy notes and tips
- Actively reflecting on your thoughts/emotions/actions and vocalizing them to another person for an hour is challenging, but it is therapeutic in and of itself
- Start with I would like to be more X and I struggle with that. Then look at and discuss specific instances where it’s all coming from. It often takes multiple sessions to get to the actual issues
- Tell the therapist what works and what doesn't
- Tell the therapist what you want to speak about
- Be open and share
- Keep a record of your thoughts with specific examples and how it made you feel to speak about it 
- The VAST majority of your time "in" therapy is actually outside of the therapy session. That's your chance to try out new skills/approaches and to reflect on what works and what doesn't. Go in and say what makes you the most uncomfortable. Sounds crazy I know, but it's usually what you need most to work on. And by doing so, you don't allow those feelings to beat you.

It's a common experience to not be able to identify your emotions. I've found it helpful to pay attention to the feelings in my body instead. Engage your senses and look for:
- hearing
- taste
- sight
- smell
- heat/cool
- pain
- pleasure
- sense of balance
- pressure
- motion

Also, realize it's okay - some feelings and emotions cannot be labelled. What's important isn't what you call it, but what you can notice from the subtleties of how we feel, as sensations in your body. This is what allows us to deeply get in touch with ourselves.
