# CBT 

Often when we start to feel better, we stop using the skills that helped us get to that point. It is actually better to keep deliberately using helpful skills until they become automatic.

Reduce relapse risk: 
-	Identifying your high-risk situations.
-	Identifying early warning signs that you are sinking deeper into depression, anxiety, anger, guilt, or shame.
-	Preparing a plan of action to help you face challenges and periods of distress

Excercise: imagine Yourself Coping
It can help to practice your plan from Worksheet 16.2 before you need it. One way to do this is to imagine one of your high-risk situations occurring in the future. Imagine this situation in great detail. What is happening? What do you see and hear? Next, imagine you are experiencing several or all of your early warning signs. How do you feel? What are you thinking? What are you doing? Now imagine putting your plan of action into effect. Spend several minutes imagining doing each step of your plan in detail. As you carry out each step in your imagination, pay attention to what you are doing, thinking, and feeling. How does this affect your mood? Thoughts? Behavior? Physical experience?
Based on this imagination exercise, how confident are you (low, medium, or high) that the plan of action you wrote in section 3 of Worksheet 16.2 will be enough to help you feel better again if you start to relapse? If your confidence level is high, then your plan is probably a good one. If you confidence in your plan is low, then you want to think about what else you can add to it that will boost your likelihood of managing future challenges. If you think the plan is a good one, but you lack confidence in your skills to carry it out, the best thing to do is to continue practicing the skills in your plan of action even when you are feeling well. Ideally, you want most of your relapse reduction skills to be fairly automatic when you are doing well, so that you can rely on them to help you if you begin to feel worse.

## Fundamentals
Cognitive Behavorial Therapy is a form of psychotherapy. A central idea in CBT is that our thoughts about an event or experience powerfully affects our emotional, behavioral, and physical responses to it. 
Once a mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen the mood. But when we feel intense moods, we are more likely to distort, discount, or dis- regard information that contradicts the validity of our moods and beliefs. In fact, the stronger our moods, the more extreme our thinking is likely to be. This is why it is helpful to be aware of our thoughts when we are most distressed. When we are aware of our thoughts, we more easily see how they are influencing our mood.

Thoughts affect physical reactions. Just as our thoughts affect our physical reactions, our physical reactions can trigger thoughts (e.g. different heartbeat can lead to think it’s a heart attack).

When understanding something, notice:
- Environment/life changes/situations: What recent changes have there been in my life (positive as well as negative)? What have been the most stressful events for me in the past year? Three years? Five years? In childhood? Do I experience any long-term or ongoing challenges (e.g., discrimination or harassment by others, physical/health challenges for me or family members, ongoing financial problems)?
- Physical reactions: What physical symptoms am I having? (Consider general changes in energy level, appetite, pain levels, and sleep, as well as occasional symptoms such as muscle tension, tiredness, rapid heartbeat, stomachaches, sweating, dizziness, and breathing difficulties.)
- What mood am I experimenting? What single words describe my most frequent or troubling moods (sad, nervous, angry, guilty, ashamed)?
- What behaviors are connected to my moods? 
- What thoughts do have? About myself? About other people? It's important to be critical about thoughts and check their accuracy. Once a mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen the mood - the problem is when the mood is strong we are no longer rational

## Thought record 
When we feel a strong mood, complete a Thought Record to : 
- Make sense of your emotional reactions
- See the bigger picture and don't react with a narrow and possibly distorted view
- Over time, it'll help you think more flexibly. Over time this can lead to easier control of moods and thoughts 
- By writing down a thought record, we likely decrease the perception of danger coming from our anxiety. 

A Thought Record consists of: 
1. Situation: Who, What, When, Where
2. Moods
  - What did you feel? (moods are described in single words). See below for tips on recognizing moods.
  - Rate each mood (0-100%)
  - Any physical reactions caused by the mood?
3. Automatic Thoughts 
  - What was going through your mind in the situation? Any thoughts, beliefs, images, memories and meanings attached to the situation. We often don’t plan/intend these thoughts, they just happen. See the list below for questions that help identify automatic thoughts. 
4. Evidence that supports the hot thought 
5. Evidence that does not support the hot thought. See below for tips
6. Alternative / Balanced Thoughts 
   - Write an alternative or balanced thought. See below for tips around this
   - Rate how much you believe each thought 
7.	Rate moods now: Rate column 2 moods and any new moods 

**How to identify moods**
- Pay attention to the body: tightness, closed
- Do it more often: notice three different moods each day
- Think back at past situations and identify moods 
- Use the list at the end of this page for inspiration

**Questions to help Identify automatic thoughts**
-	What was going through my mind?
-	What images or memories do I have in this situation? 
-	What does this mean about me? My life? My future
-	What am I afraid might happen? 
-	What is the worst that could happen?
-	What does this mean about how the other person(s) feel(s)/think(s) about me? 
-	What does this mean about the other person(s) or people in general? 
-	Did I break rules, hurt others, or not do something I should have done? What do I think about myself that I did this or believe I did this? 

**Finding evidence**
Think of your automatic thoughts as hypotesis. Don't take them as truth and look at them for what they are - thoughts made up in my mind that are likely strongly enforced because of the mood I'm feeling 

-	Have I had any experiences or is there any information that suggests that this thought is not completely true all the time?
-	If my best friend or someone I loved had this thought, what would I tell them?
-	If my best friend or someone who cares about me knew I was thinking this thought, what would they say to me? What factual evidence would they point out to me that suggests my hot thought is not 100% true?
-	Are there any small pieces of information that contradict my hot thought that I might be ignoring or discounting as not important?
-	Are there any strengths or qualities I have that I am ignoring? What are they? How might they help in this situation?
-	Are there any positives in this situation that I am ignoring? Is there any information that suggests there might be a positive outcome in this situation?
-	Have I been in this type of situation before? What happened? Is there anything different between this situation and previous ones? What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me understand this situation differently?
-	When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this type of situation any differently? How? What factual information do I focus on?
-	When I have felt this way in the past, what did I think about that helped me feel better?
-	Five years from now, if I look back at this situation, will I look at it any differently? Will I focus on any different part of my experience?
-	Am I jumping to any conclusions in columns 3 and 4 that are not completely justified by the facts?
-	Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control? What facts can I write down that reflect a more fair, compassionate, or kind view of my responsibility?

**Questions to help arrive at alternative or Balanced thinking**
What you want to do is collect evidence in favor of the alternative thought until you believe it much more. Sometimes a little bit of additional information shifts our interpretation and understanding of a situation 180 degrees
-	Now that the evidence is considered, is there an alternative or balanced way of thinking about or understanding this situation? Often it's a combination of columns 4 and 5. 
-	To write a balanced thought, write one statement summarizing all the evidence that supports my hot thought(s) (column 4), and another statement summarizing all the evidence that does not sup- port my hot thought(s) (column 5). Does combining the two summary statements with the word “and” create a balanced thought that takes into account all the information I have gathered?
-	If someone I cared about was in this situation, had these thoughts, and had this information available, what alternative view(s) of the situation would I suggest?
-	If someone who cares about me knew I had my hot thought(s), what might this person say is another way of understanding this situation?
-	If a hot thought is supported, what is the worst outcome? If a hot thought is supported, what is the best outcome? If a hot thought is supported, what is the most likely outcome?

## Accepting our thoughts
Sometimes, we need to step back and let go of our critical self. Acceptance of thoughts and moods is sometimes a worthwhile alternative to identifying, evaluating, and changing thoughts. Acceptance involves observing your thoughts, moods, and physical reactions without making judgments about them. Be curious rather than critical. 
Think about the bigger picture. What are the benefits of accepting this rather than being distressed? Are you focusing on only the negative parts of this experience and not recognizing other dimensions? Are there aspects to the situation that counterbalance the negative parts? If you can accept the parts that distress you, will you be able to enjoy or appreciate the rest of your experience more easily?

## Handling physical reactions
- Be in touch with your body and understand the feeling. Be curious about it

## Testing our assumptions
Often, anxiety is described as 'If...Then' statements. "If I speak - people will think X"

To overcome these assumptions, create experiments: 
-	Experiment: what experiment do I plan to do?
  - EXPERIMENT 1: DOES “THEN . . . ” ALWAYS FOLLOW “IF . . . ”?
  - EXPERIMENT 2: OBSERVE OTHERS AND SEE IF YOUR “IF . . . THEN . . . ” RULE APPLIES TO THEM
  - EXPERIMENT 3: DO THE OPPOSITE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
-	Prediction: what will happen based on my underlying assumptions? E.g. If I speak then I'll make a fool of myself. 
-	Possible problems: what problems might interfere with the experiment 
-	Strategies to overcome these problems: What is the plan to overcome these problems? 
-	Outcome of experiment: write down in detail what actually happens: 
  - What happened?
  - Do the outcomes match what you predicted?
  - Did anything unexpected happen?
  - If things didn’t turn out as you wanted, how well did you handle it?
-	What have I learned from this experiment about this assumption? 

## Challenging core beliefs 
Core beliefs are all-or-nothing statements about yourself, others, or the world. Identifying core beliefs by repeatedly asking yourself, “What does this mean about me?” E.g. I'm not interesting enough

Instead of testing our negative core beliefs, it is usually more helpful to identify new core beliefs that we would like to hold, and then look for evidence to support or strengthen these new core beliefs. 
- What would support these new core beliefs? 
- During the day, did I do anything, did anyone else behave or say something that fits this new belief?
- Alternatively, go out and test the new belief: 
  - What would happen if I did things that would support the new belief according to the old and the new belief? 
  - Try out the new belief (e.g. with strangers first) and write down and reflect on what happened - do your experiences support the new core beliefs? 

Other things that can help: 
- Sometimes a new core belief will include a perspective of acceptance. For example, you might choose to shift from a core belief of “People are unreliable” to one of “It is OK if people are unreliable, because I am capable and can handle it.”
- “Gratitude” means thinking about and being thankful for experiences or qualities in ourselves, other people, and the world. Start a gratitude journal that covers all this. It is more helpful to write about a few things in depth than to try to make a long list of things you are grateful for. As you practice more with gratitude, also considering mentioning what we’re grateful for to other people. 
- In addition to being grateful for the positives in our lives, another way to activate and support our new positive core beliefs is to do kind things for other people. Examples include opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend, smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs

## Anxiety
The nervousness around experiences we are going to face. Generally, its thoughts around bad things happening and thinking we're not going to be able to cope: the danger we fear is larger than our confidence in our ability to cope. When anxious, we tend to avoid situations and places where we might feel uncomfortable or anxious which makes us even more anxious when we have to do it and it doesn't help actually fixing the problem. 

![Anxiety](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28791247/101259523-0dce3b80-3721-11eb-9473-2ce18a2003bf.png)

Anxious thoughts are often covered in What Ifs: “What if I stumble over my words? What if I forget my notes? What if peo- ple think I’m stupid and don’t know what I’m talking about?” These thoughts are future-oriented and predict danger or catastrophe. 

Anxiety often arises because we don’t have control over events. When we are anxious, we try to be in control or do things perfectly, in the hope that this will prevent bad things from happening. Since we don’t have confidence that we can cope with the dangers that worry us, it makes sense that we try to prevent them. The problem with this approach is that it is really impossible to do things perfectly or have complete control over what will happen in the future. Thus learning to boost our confidence that we can cope when things go wrong is a more helpful approach to managing anxiety than trying to prevent things from going wrong.

Anxiety can be reduced either by decreasing your perception of danger or by increasing your confidence in your ability to cope with the things you fear. An important part of overcoming anxiety is learning to tolerate feeling anxious

### How to cope with anxiety 
**Understanding root cause**
You have to identify the root of your performance anxiety. Are you worried that: You don’t know the material? You can’t answer a difficult question? Your presentation is boring? You don’t come off as expert? You look stupid? You sound unpolished? Your material doesn’t flow? Nobody will show up? People don’t understand you? The audience doesn’t care? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more.

It may seem obvious, but the first thing to figure out is what exactly is making you feel stressed and to look honestly at how you are reacting in your mind, heart and body. It can help to sit down and write the answers to these questions:

- What makes me feel stressed? Think about large and small triggers, since even something that seems trivial can spark a stress spiral. Examples of small triggers might be misplacing your keys/wallet/glasses, being late for an appointment, or getting stuck behind a slow driver.
- What thoughts and emotions arise when I begin to feel stressed?
- What is happening in my body when I begin to feel stressed?

**Exposure**
To overcome anxiety, we need to learn to approach the situations or people we avoid. Through these experiences, we have an opportunity to increase our confidence in our ability to cope with the situations that frighten us. 

A Fear Ladder can help with this: the top of the ladder is the most scary thing that needs to be done. Build up the ladder and do things such that you are ready to face your big fear when the time is there. You should expect that your anxiety will increase when you first begin to approach on your Fear Ladder. This is a good sign that you are facing your fears

A good technique is also visualization: perhaps visualize the event going well and the event going bad so that you're prepared for both. Use all senses when visualizing. Imagine what you will see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. It is also helpful to imagine what you might be thinking, feeling, and doing in the situation. 

**Mindfullness and acceptance**
Most anxiety is about fears for the future. By being in the present moment, we don't think of the future and anxiety will decrease. Our mind will also not focus on the fears when we are in the present moment, which leads to a feeling of relaxation. Finally, one of the long-term benefits of mindfulness and acceptance is that they can help you tolerate and feel less anxiety, because you will learn to see your anxious thoughts as simply mental activity rather than as the truth. With practice, you can begin to understand your personal patterns of thinking and responding to events. You can learn that you don’t need to respond to your patterns of thinking and emotional reactions. Instead, you can simply observe them as they occur. People who practice mindfulness on a regular basis generally report greater feelings of calm, well-being, and acceptance of life’s difficulties.

**Breathing**
A related way to manage your anxiety is to practice balanced, deep breathing
Try breathing in to a slow count of 4 and out to a slow count of 4 for four minutes

**Progressive muscle relaxation**
“Progressive muscle relaxation” is a technique in which the major muscle groups in the body are alternately tensed and relaxed. The idea is to tense and then relax the muscles in the forehead, eyes, mouth and jaw, neck, shoulders, upper back, chest, biceps, forearms, hands, stomach, buttocks, groin, legs, thighs, calves, and feet. Each muscle group is tensed for 5 seconds and then relaxed for 10–15 seconds, then tensed again for 5 seconds and relaxed again for 10–15 seconds.

**Imagery** 
Imagery can be used to help you calm down before you enter a situation that is likely to make you feel anxious. Imagine a relaxing place and focus on how you feel - include as many senses as possible. It's a form of meditation that teaches us to focus on pleasant images to replace negative or stressful ones. When we picture more peaceful things, such as strolling on the beach at sunset, our bodies and minds become calmer. Engaging all of our senses – smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight – can make us feel that we are actually there. As we connect fully with the peaceful image, our minds and bodies become calmer and we don’t feel as stressed. Inspiration for imagination: 
- Walk to the top of a mountain. Birds singing, the light dancing through the tree branches, the smell of pine, the greenness of the forest, and the cool breeze as it touches your skin
- Imagine being someone from a movie. Imagine how this person looks, the music playing in the background, and the feeling of courage in your chest.

**Other anxiety notes**
- Separate yourself from your feelings and emotions. I am not anxiety. An anxious thought is a type of thought that can enter my brain but how I choose to respond to it and perceive it is what is going to define me.
- I’ve found it’s beneficial to learn to recognize the thought and try to just let it pass. “Oh, there went an anxious thought."
- Positive thinking is not a good solution as it doesn’t address the problem and doesn’t prepare us for the feelings we’ll feel in the moment (and we’d feel bad for feeling a certain way). A better solution is to anticipate our anxious feelings and have a plan on how to cope with them. 
- Only engage in positive self talk. Recognize negative automatic thoughts and write it down or think about it
  - Why do you believe that, what proof do you have?
  - Can it be you were mistaken or are basing this on a single or even just a few past experiences?
  - Do you past the same harsh judgment on other people in a similar situation or do you empathize with them instead? 
  - If this feeling is not true why act like is if there is no good reason to believe it.
  - Step aside of yourself and ask yourself what a good friend would tell you
- When you want to control things: do the opposite of trying to have control 
- Don’t expect anything. If there is an expectation there is anxiety and potential disappointment 
- Be able to detach from a situation and look at the situation from outside of yourself 
- If I want something, do the work today that lets me have it. No need to worry about it
- When overthinking, either become present and think of something else or refer to notes already written and possibly journal a bit
- Be much more aware of the insignificance of it all - we are here a small amount of time. Then we’re gone. Something can happen any moment that changes absolutely everything. Then what? Enjoy the time we have on this small world. The moment is all we have
- Shit does happen. We can wish things were different but we often just need to deal with reality and work with what we have left 
- To reduce worry, assume that what you fear the most is certainly going to happen 
- Think your fears though to their logical conclusion. Perfectionists often think catastrophically, ‘If i make a mistake in front of my colleagues then that will be the end of everything’, without really thinking through what ‘the end of everything’ would actually look like. Consider the worst possible outcome of your fear, then be honest with yourself about how likely that scenario actually is. Then you can start to consider how such an event would actually play out and how bad or not it would actually be.
- At some point we’ll just be tired of worrying g and being anxious and then we just do things. Same as having a near death experience. You really only have these moments so make the most of them and all the things you fear are small in the face of having 6 months to live
- Sing, smile when anxious 

## Stress
### General
- Stress is often very helpfull. When we are in danger, stress allows us to perform at our best by providing our body with energy. 
- It’s a problem when we are stressed for too long. When stressed, our body releases stress hormones that give us extra energy to deal with situations. Just thinking stressful thoughts can cause our body to release stress hormones as it gets ready to face a threat.

## Panic attacks
- Physically remove from situation - don't do what you were doing, and move
- Force some strong body senses that break current thought patters - e.g. hold ice cubes, bite in lemon 
- Further be strongly aware of senses that change thought patters: 5 things to see, hear, smell
- Flex your muscles in some part then others and be aware 

## Flying 
- I am aware that during a flight, I can strongly feel the movements. It’s a natural phenomenon that isn’t actually dangerous looking at the statistics. Turbulence is just a bumpy road - if in a train I wouldn’t feel as bad. 
- When there is turbulence, try to comfort yourself. Realise it’s okay to feel that way because you’re not in control. However, also realize that the pilots are the right people to look after your journey. Realize you’re not in control any more so just let it happen. 
- Tons of flights happen daily successfully.
- From experience, it’ll be just fine / it will soon pass
- Imagine how role models would behave

## Dentist
- As part of life, I need to look after my health. Dental health is part of that and this is done by going to the dentist 1x a year for a check-up and a clean up. 
- I prepare for this by cleaning my teeth 2x a day and flossing. That’s all I can do. What has happened with my teeth in the meantime isn’t in my control so until I go to the dentist, I shouldn’t worry about it. I accept whatever happens - I surrender 
- If something happens and I need to be fixed, it’s amazing that it’s possible. I am grateful that health care is at a state where I can be fixed, probably under drugs to avoid the pain. I realize something needs happening for my own benefit and then I surrender to the event being treated by someone who knows what they’re doing. I’m aware it will hurt and feel painful but I accept that as part of the process - it’s what makes me better and I’ll come out stronger eventually - this too shall pass. 
- Approach is with curiosity and to just see what happens because we don't know what it'll be like. Don't have any expectations. 
- Imagine how role models would behave
- “Just get it over with sooner rather than later” 
- Life isn’t always about having no pain - it’s all part of life. 
- Put in headphones to distract myself 
- Focus on your breathing - perhaps tense muscles and pay full attention to those and then others. The pain is just another sensation. Another option is to embrace any discomfort, loud noise, or pain. Non-judgmentally observe it and breathe deeply.
- Man up 
- To get over the dentist go to the dentist and deal with it. You’re going to go anyway so why worry about it
- Decide and then surrender because it’s no longer in control. In the meantime use techniques: mindfulness and distraction in the form of music to survive

## Cognitive distortions
Cognitive distortions are simply ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn’t really true. These inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions — telling ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling bad about ourselves.

**Filtering**
A person engaging in filter (or “mental filtering) takes the negative details and magnifies those details while filtering out all positive aspects of a situation. For instance, a person may pick out a single, unpleasant detail and dwell on it exclusively so that their vision of reality becomes darkened or distorted. When a cognitive filter is applied, the person sees only the negative and ignores anything positive.

**Polarized Thinking (or “Black and White” Thinking)**
In polarized thinking, things are either “black-or-white” — all or nothing. We have to be perfect or we’re a complete and abject failure — there is no middle ground. A person with polarized thinking places people or situations in “either/or” categories, with no shades of gray or allowing for the complexity of most people and most situations. A person with black-and-white thinking sees things only in extremes.

**Overgeneralization**
In this cognitive distortion, a person comes to a general conclusion based on a single incident or a single piece of evidence. If something bad happens just once, they expect it to happen over and over again. A person may see a single, unpleasant event as part of a never-ending pattern of defeat.

For instance, if a student gets a poor grade on one paper in one semester, they conclude they are a horrible student and should quit school.

**Jumping to Conclusions**
Without individuals saying so, a person who jumps to conclusions knows what another person is feeling and thinking — and exactly why they act the way they do. In particular, a person is able to determine how others are feeling toward the person, as though they could read their mind. Jumping to conclusions can also manifest itself as fortune-telling, where a person believes their entire future is pre-ordained (whether it be in school, work, or romantic relationships).

For example, a person may conclude that someone is holding a grudge against them, but doesn’t actually bother to find out if they are correct. Another example involving fortune-telling is when a person may anticipate that things will turn out badly in their next relationship, and will feel convinced that their prediction is already an established fact, so why bother dating.

**Catastrophizing**
When a person engages in catastrophizing, they expect disaster to strike, no matter what. This is also referred to as magnifying, and can also come out in its opposite behavior, minimizing. In this distortion, a person hears about a problem and uses what if questions (e.g., “What if tragedy strikes?” “What if it happens to me?”) to imagine the absolute worst occurring.

For example, a person might exaggerate the importance of insignificant events (such as their mistake, or someone else’s achievement). Or they may inappropriately shrink the magnitude of significant events until they appear tiny (for example, a person’s own desirable qualities or someone else’s imperfections).

**Personalization**
Personalization is a distortion where a person believes that everything others do or say is some kind of direct, personal reaction to them. They literally take virtually everything personally, even when something is not meant in that way. A person who experiences this kind of thinking will also compare themselves to others, trying to determine who is smarter, better looking, etc.

A person engaging in personalization may also see themselves as the cause of some unhealthy external event that they were not responsible for. For example, “We were late to the dinner party and caused everyone to have a terrible time. If I had only pushed my husband to leave on time, this wouldn’t have happened.”

**Control Fallacies**
This distortion involves two different but related beliefs about being in complete control of every situation in a person’s life. In the first, if we feel externally controlled, we see ourselves as helpless a victim of fate. For example, “I can’t help it if the quality of the work is poor, my boss demanded I work overtime on it.”

The fallacy of internal control has us assuming responsibility for the pain and happiness of everyone around us. For example, “Why aren’t you happy? Is it because of something I did?”

**Emotional Reasoning**
The distortion of emotional reasoning can be summed up by the statement, “If I feel that way, it must be true.” Whatever a person is feeling is believed to be true automatically and unconditionally. If a person feels stupid and boring, then they must be stupid and boring.

Emotions are extremely strong in people, and can overrule our rational thoughts and reasoning. Emotional reasoning is when a person’s emotions takes over our thinking entirely, blotting out all rationality and logic. The person who engages in emotional reasoning assumes that their unhealthy emotions reflect the way things really are — “I feel it, therefore it must be true."

**Shoulds**
Should statements (“I should pick up after myself more…”) appear as a list of ironclad rules about how every person should behave. People who break the rules make a person following these should statements angry. They also feel guilty when they violate their own rules. A person may often believe they are trying to motivate themselves with shoulds and shouldn’ts, as if they have to be punished before they can do anything.

For example, “I really should exercise. I shouldn’t be so lazy.” Musts and oughts are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When a person directs should statements toward others, they often feel anger, frustration and resentment.

**Fallacy of Fairness**
In the fallacy of fairness, a person feels resentful because they think that they know what is fair, but other people won’t agree with them. As our parents tell us when we’re growing up and something doesn’t go our way, “Life isn’t always fair.” People who go through life applying a measuring ruler against every situation judging its “fairness” will often feel resentful, angry, and even hopelessness because of it. Because life isn’t fair — things will not always work out in a person’s favor, even when they should.

**Blaming**
When a person engages in blaming, they hold other people responsible for their emotional pain. They may also take the opposite track and instead blame themselves for every problem — even those clearly outside their own control.

For example, “Stop making me feel bad about myself!” Nobody can “make” us feel any particular way — only we have control over our own emotions and emotional reactions.

**Fallacy of Change**
In the fallacy of change, a person expects that other people will change to suit them if they just pressure or cajole them enough. A person needs to change people because their hopes for success and happiness seem to depend entirely on them.

This distortion is often found in thinking around relationships. For example, a girlfriend who tries to get her boyfriend to improve his appearance and manners, in the belief that this boyfriend is perfect in every other way and will make them happy if they only changed these few minor things.

**Global Labeling**
In global labeling (also referred to as mislabeling), a person generalizes one or two qualities into a negative global judgment about themselves or another person. This is an extreme form of overgeneralizing. Instead of describing an error in context of a specific situation, a person will attach an unhealthy universal label to themselves or others.

For example, they may say, “I’m a loser” in a situation where they failed at a specific task. When someone else’s behavior rubs a person the wrong way — without bothering to understand any context around why — they may attach an unhealthy label to him, such as “He’s a real jerk.”

Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded. For example, instead of saying someone drops her children off at daycare every day, a person who is mislabeling might say that “She abandons her children to strangers.”

**Always Being Right**
When a person engages in this distortion, they are continually putting other people on trial to prove that their own opinions and actions are the absolute correct ones. To a person engaging in “always being right,” being wrong is unthinkable — they will go to any length to demonstrate their rightness.

For example, “I don’t care how badly arguing with me makes you feel, I’m going to win this argument no matter what because I’m right.” Being right often is more important than the feelings of others around a person who engages in this cognitive distortion, even loved ones.

**Heaven’s Reward Fallacy**
The final cognitive distortion is the false belief that a person’s sacrifice and self-denial will eventually pay off, as if some global force is keeping score. This is a riff on the fallacy of fairness, because in a fair world, the people who work the hardest will get the largest reward. A person who sacrifices and works hard but doesn’t experience the expected pay off will usually feel bitter when the reward doesn’t come.

## How to fix cognitive distortions
**Identify the Cognitive Distortion**
The most important step of fixing any problem in your life is identifying exactly what the problem is and how extensive it is in your life. You do this by creating a list of the troublesome thoughts throughout the day, as you’re having them. This process allows you to think about each problem or predicament in a more natural or realistic manner.

**Examine the Evidence**
The next step is to remove yourself from the emotionality of the upsetting event or episode of irrational thinking in order to examine the evidence more objectively. A thorough examination of an experience allows you to identify the basis for your distorted thoughts. If you are overly self-critical, you should identify a number of experiences and situations where you had success.

One effective method for examining the evidence is to look at individual thoughts connected to the event, and objectively decide whether those statements reflect an opinion or stone cold fact. For example, statements such as “I’m selfish” and “There’s something wrong with me” are opinions. “My co-worker spoke in angry voice toward me” and “I forgot to take out the trash” are facts. Segregating facts from opinions can help you determine which are likely to be a component of a cognitive distortion (the opinions) and therefore need your focus and efforts to undo.

**Double Standard Method**
An alternative to “self-talk” that is harsh and demeaning is to talk to ourselves in the same compassionate and caring way that we would talk with a friend in a similar situation. We are frequently much harder on ourselves than the people we care about in our lives, whether it be a friend or family member. We would never think of speaking to a close friend in the way we speak to ourselves in our own mind.

Instead of treating yourself with a different standard than what you hold everyone else to, why not use one single standard for everyone including yourself? Isn’t that more fair than using a double-standard? Give yourself the same encouragement that you would a trusted friend.

Imagine studying for an exam and telling a friend, “You’re going to screw this up, just like you screw everything else up!” Yet these are the same kinds of thoughts that run through many students’ minds before an exam. Can you answer such automatic, negative thoughts back with a rational response? For example, “You’re going to do well on this exam, I just know it. You studied hard for it and did your best to memorize the material. I believe in you.”

**Thinking in Shades of Gray**
Learning to undo black-and-white (or polarized) thinking can be challenging, because our minds take cognitive shortcuts to simplify processing of stimuli in order to hurry our ability to make a decision or choose a response. Black-and-white thinking can sometimes serve a good purpose, but it often leads a person down a path of irrational belief too.

Instead of thinking about a problem or predicament in an either-or polarity, thinking in shades of gray requires us to evaluate things on a scale of 0 through 100. When a plan or goal is not fully realized, think about and evaluate the experience as a partial success on this kind of scale.

For example, someone might think, “You can’t do anything right. You just blew your diet by having that second bite of ice cream.” What is the likelihood that a person’s entire dieting routine — that they’ve been following rigorously for months — is now made worthless by a single additional bite of ice cream? On our scale of 0 through 100, it might be about 1 percent likelihood.

**Experimental Method**
For example, let’s say you’ve been putting off organizing your digital photos because it’ll be “too hard” or “I just can’t do it.” What if the task was broken down into smaller parts, such as tackling just a single month at a time in one sitting? Is the thought that it’s just “too hard” still true, now that you’ve broken the task into smaller, attainable components?

In another example, imagine a person who believes over time that she is no longer liked by her friends because they never connect with her on social media or call. Could that person test whether it was true that her friends no longer like her? What if she reached out to them and asked them out to lunch or for drinks one day? While it’s not likely all of her friends will accept an invitation, it’s likely at least one or two of them will, providing clear evidence in support of the fact that her friends still like her.

**Survey Method**
Similar to the experimental method, the survey method is focused on asking others in a similar situation about their experiences to determine how irrational our thoughts might be. Using this method, a person seeks the opinions of others regarding whether their thoughts and attitudes are realistic.

For example, a person might believe, “Romantic partners should never fight. And if they do fight, they should never go to bed angry at one another.” Who could they survey to see whether this is true or not? A few friends who appear to be in happy relationships might be a good start. That person would soon realize that all couples fight, and while it may be a good idea not to go to bed angry, plenty of people do and their relationship is just fine despite that.

If you want to double-check on the rationality of your thought, check in with a few trusted friends to see what their opinions and experiences are.

**The Semantic Method**
When a person engages in a series of should statements (“I should do this” or “I shouldn’t do that”), they are applying a set of unwritten rules to their behavior that may make little sense to others. Should statements imply a judgment about your or another person’s behavior — one that may be unhelpful and even hurtful.

Every time you find yourself using a should statement, try substituting “It would be nice if…” instead. This semantic difference can work wonders in your own mind, as you stop “should-ing” yourself to death and start looking at the world in a different, more positive manner. Shoulds make a person feel bad and guilty about themselves. “Wouldn’t it be nice and more healthy if I started watching what I ate more?” puts the thought into a more curious, inquisitive phrasing — one where the answer might be yes, but might also be no (for instance, if you’ve just started cancer treatment, now’s not a good time to change your eating habits).

**Definitions**
For people who are more intellectual and like to argue about minutiae, this method of arguing with your cognitive distortions might come in handy. What does it mean to define ourselves as “inferior,” “a loser,” “a fool,” or “abnormal.” An examination of these and other global labels may reveal that they more closely represent specific behaviors, or an identifiable behavior pattern, instead of the total person.

When a person starts delving into the definition of a label and asking questions about those definitions, the results can be surprising. For instance, what it does it mean to think of yourself as “inferior”? Inferior to who? Others at your workplace? What are their specific work experiences and backgrounds? Aren’t they all inferior to someone else too? The more questions you ask when challenging a definition or label, the more you may come to realize the uselessness of such labels — especially when applied to ourselves.

**Re-attribution**
In personalization and blaming cognitive distortions, a person will point the finger to themselves for all of the negative things they experience, no matter what the actual cause.

In re-attribution, a person identifies external factors and other individuals that contributed to the problem or event. Regardless of the degree of responsibility a person assumes, a person’s energy is best utilized in the pursuit of resolutions to problems or identifying ways to cope with predicaments. By assigning responsibility accordingly, you’re not trying to deflect blame, but ensure you’re not blaming yourself entirely for something that wasn’t entirely your fault.

For example, if a project at work failed to get done on time and you were one of the members of the 5-member team, you’re one-fifth to blame for the project missing its deadline. From an objective perspective, you are not entirely to blame for the missed deadline.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**
This method for answering an irrational belief relies on motivation rather than facts to help a person undo the cognitive distortion. In this technique, it is helpful to list the advantages and disadvantages of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. A cost-benefit analysis will help to figure out what a person is gaining from feeling bad, distorted thinking, and inappropriate behavior.

“How will it help me to believe this negative, irrational thought, and how will it hurt me?” If you find the disadvantages of believing a thought outweigh the advantages, you’ll find it easier to talk back and refute the irrational belief.
