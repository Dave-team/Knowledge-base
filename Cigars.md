# Cigars

**Humidification**
Between 65-70%. Cheap option are Boveda Packs

**Storage**
Tupperware

**Cutting**
Tiny amount just above the cap, still within the ring such that we don't cut off the entire end part to keep things sturdy

**Toasting**
To toast a cigar, simply hold the flame far enough away from the cigar that it is heating the foot of the cigar and slowly rotate it. This will get the tobacco at the foot of the cigar glowing evenly, but not actually lighting the tobacco. Check the foot of the cigar to make sure it is burning evenly.

**Smoking technique**
Retrohaling a Cigar
Retrohaling is a great technique that allows you to taste the more of the flavors from a cigar. It is simply a method for pushing a little bit of the smoke out from your nose as well as your mouth during the exhale.

How do you Retrohale?
*First take a good puff of your cigar, and let around half of it out of your mouth. Don't inhale or swallow the smoke. With the your mouth close, gently push the smoke to the back of your mouth and at the same time start exhaling through your nose. That's it!
