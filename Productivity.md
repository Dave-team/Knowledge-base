# Productivity
 
## Principles
- Do as little as needed, not as much as possible 
- Working on the wrong thing is the worst waste of all 
- Focus on most important tasks and cut the rest
- Think harder about what to spend time on and about what to actually work on
- What 20% generates 80% of the outcome, but also: what 80% is mostly useless? 
- Learn to say no – that will get you the most done in the long term, which matters most 
- Listen to your body and mind. Rest and take a step back when it's needed 
- Being productive is about optimizing time to spend more time on things you enjoy doing 
- Consider time boxing what you're working on to avoid situations where you spent too much time 
- Write down your most important goals and regularly check against these notes to ensure you're working on the most important thing 
- Listen to your body: there will be times when you feel low energy - pushing through this is likely counterproductive. Instead, recharge and realize you can be productive again a different time 

## Process
- Planning in the morning: 
    - Determine the most important thing to be done 
    - Have 2 or 3 other high priority tasks 
    - Always make sure these goals are also measurable
- Execution 
    - Do the most important thing first 
    - Do things based on your energy levels - do the hardest things early in the morning 
    - Finish a task completely prior to moving on to the next task 
    - Eliminate distractions
    - Actions to perform from email are left unread and put in to do list
- Reflect on performance at the end of each day and set goals for the next day (3 things max)

## Techniques
- Deep work: work in chunks of time without interruption
- Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes and then take 5 minutes break - do something completely different in these breaks  
- Plan your time: 
    - Plan your days in Google Calendar. This is your ideal week
    - Record how you actually spent your time
    - Make adjustments to get closer to the desired use of time 
- When exhausted from a task: 
    - Work on something simple - I am quite good at context switching
    - Take a break 
- When tired: 
    - Take a walk
    - Do something else entirely (read a book, read the news, watch a Youtube)
    - Do some form of excercise
    - Drink lots of water
    - Heavy breathing


## Habits
- Give yourself specific triggers to implement your new habits. E.g.: ‘when I get home, first thing is putting on running shoes and go for a run’. 
- Set up systems to take care of day to day tasks (e.g. eating the same every morning) 
- To change or build habits: 
    - Have a cue (e.g. waking up in the morning)
    - Have a routine: first thing you do is meditate
    - Reward: feel better about yourself 

## Working from home
- Take it easy in the morning. Exercise, read a book and have breakfast. This will get you in the right mood - you are trying to build a commute in your way as a way of getting ready for work 
- Only turn on the laptop when ready to work
- Take regular breaks to have a snack, drink a tea or read a few pages in a book 
- Overcommunicate with others in the team - jump on quick calls. Also set up social calls with some colleagues  
- When stopping working, make sure to wind down. E.g. call/text a friend, watch something fun, clean up, go for a walk. Make sure there is a clear separation between work and personal time 

## Goal organization
### Goalss listing
4 text files that work well for both work and personal 
- To do - year
- To do - month
- To do - week
- To do - day 

### Personal action plan
- What: what do I am doing/learning/improving
- Why: why do I want this? What impact can this change have?
- How: how will the change be done? (break this down – some projects are quite big but you might be able to perform part of it this week – so you have multiple rows here each with a unique by when date)
- Support: what support do I need to deliver this change?
- By when: what date do we need this by?  

## Email 
- Look at it first and last thing of the day
- Answer or file all emails – inbox 0 is the goal
- Structure: 
    - Emails to answer soon are left unread and a note is added to my to do list
    - Pending: emails you know you’ll have to deal with again, but later
    - Review: emails with things you want to read in depth 
    - Individual folders for everything else to archive the emails 
- Never leave an email unread for more than a week. It should be in a different folder if so 
- Go through pending and review at least once a week and either archieve or action the items 

## Getting things done
- Aim: get everything out of your head to reduce cognitive load. Everything is organized / grouped to make it easiest to action 
- 


### Other
- Make the bed each morning to set a good start of the day
- A good way to tag/group tasks is based on levels of energy: Focus - Long. Focus Short. Brain Dead Long
- If today only had 2 hours, what would I do that has the most impact?
- What is the one thing I can do today that makes everything easier or even unneccessary?
