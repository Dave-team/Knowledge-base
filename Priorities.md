# Priorities
This is a list of things I am actively working on to develop myself. 
Relax. Be optimistic. Be present. Have faith in ability to just figure things out. 

Pick up good habits from the knowledge base and make these my own. This is not about doing it all at once, pick a few to actively work on for the next weeks/months. Then work on them relaxed and step by step. 

Affirm these on a daily basis, regularly take mindful breaks especially when I’m feeling overwhelmed. And then reflect on my performance against the habits / philosophy. 

## Reminders
### General
- The main overarching goal is happiness and the biggest win in this is having a consistent calm mind. 
- Happiness is a choice - we can choose to be down or realize that life is short and make the most of it. Be the person who is happy and grateful regardless of anything else. When life flashes by, make sure its worth watching - “how was the trip, man?”
- Relax and not take myself and life so seriously. 
- Force yourself to slow down occasionally and just take it easy.
- Balance my time between work, development and hobbies more. Perform hobbies for the sake of doing them only but it may require some forcing of this hobby time and even when bored, embrace the boredom and see what comes of it - get off the development train.
- Build confidence by remind yourself that you’ve studied in Hong Kong, worked in Berlin, got a job in London and are now a BI Manager at a great company. Remind yourself of how awesome this is and how grateful you are you’ve done this. It’s easy to forget what we have. 
- Approach the future with curiosity and optimism - what else will happen? Trust that someone else will be out there who will fit and whom I will be in a happy relationship with. I used to be the person that didn’t like settling, was curious and wanted to explore. If we continued, that would have been the only relationship I’d ever have. Don’t expect to control everything - flow like water instead. 
- Realize that we need to deal with life and sometimes we get beat down. It’s not about how hard you are hit but about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That’s how character is built and how a life becomes rich. It’s during times of being down that we really grow and we can respond like a man and show what I’m made of. 
- Things will heal with time if we work on ourselves and look after ourselves first. 

### Acceptance and self awareness
- Let go of yourself and your ego. Stop thinking you're that special and can't share things. 
- Stop thinking everyone expects something perfect. Go with the flow and open your heart. 
- Accept myself and things the way they are. Don't force things. It's okay - I am good enough. It's okay whatever the outcome is. I'm not perfect and that's ok. 
- Go deep inside yourself and get to know you. Be confident sharing personal experiences, understand your emotions and feelings. 

### Mindfullness 
- Be more present. Observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Accepting our experiences and thoughts without making judgments about them. 
- Understand that the thinking mind is looking at thoughts and wants to solve them and not let them go. Instead, realize that thoughts are just thoughts, not facts and they often don't need to be solved, especially not in your head. 
- Instead, bring full awareness to the present moment: 
  - Be mindful about what you're doing. Show interest in care whilst eating, drinking, walking, brushing teeth etc. 
  - Regularly taking a pause from what we're doing and tune into our breathing, our senses, our moods how our bodies feel.
  - Relax, look around you and just sit. Be amazed at how beautiful things are. How far we’ve come in our lives and in the universe and be grateful. 
- When thoughts arise, just notice them but don't focus on them - I am not my thoughts. Refocus to your senses and your body. Go in debugging mode. Ask yourself: “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” 
- When anxious, understand what you are anxious about and put those fears on paper (CBT). Then realize it's okay and doesn't need to be solved now. Then go on do your thing.  

### Social support 
- Don’t solve all problems myself: share my thoughts with friends, family and a therapist 

### Visualization
- Happy and at peace - I can do nothing for an hour and step out the race
- Well rounded person with interesting hobbies and opinions on a wide range of topics that come in handy during social conversations
- Enjoys being around others, sees friends regularly and engages in conversation (+visualize how these conversations actually go, including stating opinions and what I actually say)
- Energetic and enthusiastic in all areas of life
- A good public speaker
- More strategic and leadership at work 
- Use a 'Master Mind if that helps'

## Work
Dave is his own brand and Dave wants to be head of BI. As part of this role he needs to solve technical challenges, overcome them, work well with stakeholders, have integrity, communicate context to non technical stakeholders, provide context and relate to impact, sell his work during effective communications and present in public what great work Dave is doing. Whilst I have these ambitions, I am not my work. I am my values, my hobbies, my loved ones, my health much more than my job so prioritize it accordinly to the context of happiness as the main goal. 

Pointers around development 
- Don’t be afraid to speak up if I believe there are better ways or if I believe I have context that others don’t. 
- Also don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed
- Being too nice is not going to work long term. Value your time and know your worth and being too soft isn’t good for anyone either
- I now need to take ownership over the tickets, the Inbox, etc.
- Improve on the commercial side of things. Contracts, legal, pricing, negotiation. Start collecting best practices and templates were using at work
- Don’t dive into a solution without seeing an example. Look at the data - ask what the problem is. Then ask what they think the best next step is.


Things I actively pay attention to and work on: 

**Approach projects in a good way**
- When dealing with complexities (e.g. when stuck, something looks complex or time consuming), remain relaxed at first and don't go into panic model, rushing to an outcome. Take a step back (potentially put it completely aside and sleep on it). Nobody demands perfection and have no expectations of perfection yourself - gradually I will increase my experience - by calmly solving problems we encounter. If things take longer, then that's how it is - take your time and nobody is putting unrealistic pressure on you. Keep open and honest communication with your stakeholders. 
- Do things step by step starting with the foundation. Make sure you have thought well about the approach. Understand the root of the problem first. Break projects down into attaintable steps. Try to find the easiest and least constraining way of doing things. When I can't figure it out, ask for a brainstorm session.
- Build things incrementally and make sure there is a good way to measure impact of what you're working on. 
- Keep the growth mindset: Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism and realize there's something to learn

**Have more context**
- Be more involved with Notion and make sure to be aware of what the team is working on 

**Stakeholder relationships**
- Be social. Show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me 

**Initiative during meetings**
- Always go into meetings with context of the problem at hand. Have context then know the logical high level things to look for and then steer people in that direction give context and prioritise
- Understand your role in the situation and take ownership over that. When you don't know, say it. When you don't understand, ask. Know that you are there for a reason. 
- Ask whatever you want to ask. They know I’m not stupid, I’m just not as knowledgeable about this area perhaps 
- Again, it’s not personal - it’s about doing the best for the company and it’s actually critical for me to speak up as this is what I will be paid for 
- Speak up during (team) meetings. 

**Team meetings**
- Own your job: I am technically capable, I ensure I work on the right things and I work hard. I keep the bigger picture in mind and I keep my stakeholders up to date. As long as I do that, I can have confidence that I'm doing the right things. 
- Focus on providing value: the value is in work, that I communicate. Am I not my work so I am not relevant to these communications. That said, I still am proud of the work and want to present it. 
- Don't be stuck in my own mind and focus on value. Listen attentively and just be present - ask questions, give opinions.  
- Realize whatever I do is the most important that needs to be done. Don't focus on other things that don't get done as a result - they are simply pushed back. 
- Don't personalize with the work you have do or will do: you are not your work. 
- Focus on the positives during the meetings. 

**Public speaking** 
It is going to happen and I accept my anxiety. It’s something I want to be become better at so I want to do it and now I have the opportunity. I will prepare well. I will understand my thoughts and stay optimistic. When the nerves arise, it’s okay. I knew they were coming. I knew I would get an increased heart beat and sweaty palms because I’ve been there before. All is well - I will get through this. I am enthusiastic about it, am well prepared and I survived in the past.

- Take on all opportunities to further develop public speaking skills - don't shy away because you're scared of anxiety. Face the anxiety instead and over time it'll be less bad
- I want to become a good public speaker because it'll help me greatly in life and it's required for any significant next step in my career - every next step will have greater public speaking challenges so each time I present will be small compared to the next time. 
- Represent your own brand and seperate your presentation from your job. Imagine being a consultant to the company and present without my personally being associated to the job. 
- Every presentation is an experiment: Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. Each time you try to do the best you can prepare for. I know I need to speak in public and I know I struggle with it. I will feel nerves and there is some imposter syndrome. However, each time I try to prepare, do what I can control and that's it. The rest just happens and needs to be accepted - one I do, there will be a sense of calm which will automatically improve performance. 

**Keeping a work life balance**
- Seperate work from who I am as a person. Don’t take work personally and realize that we can ask help of others. 
- Take it more easy - you cannot solve everything immediately and things will never be perfect. 

**Work towards Head of BI role**
- Visualize yourself being head of BI - you know the right things to do and those things are getting done. Keep a calm mind, take steps back to see the bigger picture and communicate with confidence. 
- Sometimes, step out the ad hoc fires to fix, projects to do mentally and look at the future and other developments instead. 

**Maintain a balance between ad hoc, roadmap, and development**

**Be specific in agendas**

**Be proactive in onboarding users**

## Social 
I am a social creature. I'm interested in others, want to know them better and I enjoy conversation as a way of making potential friendships. In one on one conversations, I go deep into topics of interests of both parties and in larger group settings, I want to be part of the conversation and to share my thoughts and experiences because it adds value to everyone involved: people can respond to my thoughts. 

**I love and care for my friends**
I make sure I reach out regularly to my friends. I think about them regularly and I aim to meet. I show that I care. 

**I want to get to know more people**
I am inheritely a social being, want to expand my circle of friends and meet people with similar interests 

**I am interesting and people want to hear what I say**
My life is interesting - I have great friends, I have travelled quite a bit and I am working on become more an all-round person. I'm living the life I want to live and sharing my life with others is what will make it even richer. 

**The more I open up, the more honest I am with myself which will lead to stronger relationships**
When you open up you allow others in your life. Being a closed box tends to move people away so be more open and vulnerable. 

**I am able to handle anything that might be said to me** 
Because I am confortable with who I am, I can handle questions of others and I am happy to be vulnerable. Trust in my creative capabilities to handle it. That said, people may judge, people may laugh, people may make fun of me. Such is life. Important to note is that those people are not important to me. Finally, I have the option to not open up when things become too personal and others will accept that. 

**Whatever I say is okay**
Stop trying to be perfect and just say the things that come up without thinking whether it’s good enough. Just be you. Personal questions are personal to me, so just be vulnerable. In group conversations, it mainly doesn't matter what you say - you just need to say whatever you think as the topic will move on quickly. 
Nobody demands perfection - that's just in my head. I'm not as important as to never be allowed to make mistakes. I do and I will continue to and that's okay - Expose yourself as this non perfect human being
