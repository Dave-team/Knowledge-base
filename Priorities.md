# Priorities
This is a list of things I am actively working on to develop myself. 

## General
- Be enthusiastic and energetic 
- Visualize myself as: 
  - Someone who is content with life
  - Can keep a calm even when stress/stakes are high which allows me to think on my feet
  - Enjoys being around others, sees friends regularly and engages in conversation (+visualize how these conversations actually go, including stating opinions and what I actually say)
  - A good public speaker
  - Has interesting hobbies during free time including working out 
  - Is quite ambitious and enthusiastic about data - aiming for a Head of BI role.   
- Let go of yourself and your ego. Stop thinking your that special and can't share things. Stop thinking everyone expects something perfect. Go with the flow and open your heart. 

## Work
Dave is his own brand and dave wants to be head of BI. As part of this role he needs to solve technical challenges, overcome them, work well with stakeholders, have integrity, communicate context to non technical stakeholders, provide context and relate to impact, sell his work during effective communications and present in public what great work Dave is doing. 

Things I actively pay attention to and work on: 

**Stakeholder relationships**
- Be social. Show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me 

**Initiative during meetings**
- Speak up during (team) meetings. See Social to overcome this anxiety. 
- Understand your role in the situation and take ownership over that. When you don't know, say it. When you don't understand, ask. Know that you are there for a reason. 

**Team meetings**
- Own your job: I am technically capable, I ensure I work on the right things and I work hard. I keep the bigger picture in mind and I keep my stakeholders up to date. As long as I do that, I can have confidence that I'm doing the right things. 
- The value is in the work that gets done that helps the business. My personal performance is secondary to that and my ego shouldn't be impacted from the work I do - because I am not my work. 

**Public speaking** 
- Take on all opportunities to further develop public speaking skills - don't shy away because you're scared of anxiety. Face the anxiety instead and over time it'll be less bad
- I want to become a good public speaker because it'll help me greatly in life. To make the next step in my career, I need to have the confidence that I know my craft, am working on the right strategic goals and am capable. 
- It's natural to be anxious and nervous around presenting in public. They ensure I am sharp and at my best performance. 

**Solving hard challenges**
- Growth mindset: Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism 
- Make use of other people at the right times

**Keeping a work life balance**
- Seperate work from who I am as a person. Don’t take work personally and realize that we can ask help of others. 

**Work towards Head of BI role**
- Visualize yourself being head of BI - you know the right things to do and those things are getting done. Keep a calm mind, take steps back to see the bigger picture and communicate with confidence. 

**Maintain a balance between ad hoc, roadmap, and development**


## Social 
Dave is a social person. He is interested in other people, he wants to know more about them and he enjoys conversation. In one on one conversations, he can deep into topics of interests of both parties and in larger group settings, he loves to be part of the conversation and to share his thoughts and experiences because it adds value to everyone involved: people can respond to Dave and Dave feels valued and heard - he said what he wanted to say. 

**I am interesting and people want to hear what I say**
My life is interesting - I have great friends, I have travelled quite a bit and I am working on become more an all-round person. I'm living the life I want to live and sharing my life with others is what will make it even richer. 

**The more I open up, the more honest I am with myself which will lead to stronger relationships**
When you open up you allow others in your life. Being a closed box tends to move people away so be more open and vulnerable. 

**I am able to handle anything that might be said to me** 
People may judge, people may laugh, people may make fun of me. Such is life. Important to note is that those people are not important to me. Because I am confortable with who I am, I can handle questions of others and I am happy to be vulnerable. Finally, I have the option to not open up when things become too personal and others will accept that.

**Whatever I say is okay**
Stop trying to be perfect and just say the things that come up without thinking whether it’s good enough. Just be you.









## Focusing on the right things
Personal development is like porn. It makes you feel good for a short period of time but it’s a distraction from the thing you know you need to do which is meditation, reflection on self awareness, reading non personal development books, get inspired by hobbies, visualise yourself having overcome your fears
