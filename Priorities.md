# Priorities
This is a list of things I am actively working on to develop myself.
Relax. Be optimistic. Be present. Have faith in ability to just figure things out.
 
Pick up good habits from the knowledge base and make these my own. This is not about doing it all at once, pick a few to actively work on for the next weeks/months.
- Affirm these habits and visualize implementing them in detail on a daily basis, both in relaxing and in stressful times. Visualize being the person of your design and how that person acts in challenging situations. Then practice that (fake confidence if needed) until it becomes natural. 
- Force regular mindful breaks. When relaxed to change the structure of the brain. When not aware to accept, let go and move on. Be aware and breath.
- Reflect on my performance against the habits / philosophy regularly and adjust where necessary. How did I behave? Why? What can be done better? What lessons can I learn from this? Potentially journal about this. 
 
## General Reminders
- **Remember the insignifance of it all** We are a blip in the grand scheme of history. We are evolved monkeys that will evolve into something else. We are simply creatures in the universe. 
- **Choose happiness** The main overarching goal is happiness and the biggest win in this is having a consistent calm mind. Happiness is a choice - we can choose to dance, smile and remember that the world is an amazing place. Be the person who is happy and grateful regardless of anything else. If we're too caught up we stop seeing the positive and life just passes by. When life flashes by, make sure its worth watching - “how was the trip, man?”
- **Mememto mori** Be much more aware of the insignificance of it all - we are here a small amount of time. Then we’re gone. Something can happen any moment that changes absolutely everything. Then what? Enjoy the time we have on this small world. The moment is all we have
- **Trust yourself** Have confidence and faith in yourself that you can handle things. Trust our creative mechanism to perform good. You did it before.
- **Relax and not take myself and life so seriously**. Force yourself to slow down occasionally and just take it easy. Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state.
- **Remember the positives**. Build confidence by remembering what I've achieved and accomplished so far and some of the amazing things I've had a change to experience and now have memories of.  I studied in Hong Kong, worked in Berlin, got a job in London and are now a BI Manager at a great company. Remind yourself of how awesome this is and how grateful you are you’ve done this. It’s easy to forget what we have. When remembering something negative, think back about when it was actually positive.
- **Approach the future with curiosity and optimism** - what else is in store for me?
- **Surrender** Life is random and most things are not in my control. Surrender to whatever will happen and just enjoy the ride. Try not to have any expectations and don't allow your ego to get too involved. Flow like water, ride the waves and open your heart.
- **Be curious** Approach things with childlike curiosity and look at things as learning experiences without our preconceived notions. Life is amazing to the curiously minded
- **Deal with reality** Shit does happen. We can wish things were different but we often just need to deal with reality and work with what we have left. This is what defines us, helps build self confidence and character.
- **Acceptance** I am human. I make mistakes. I have feelings and thoughts will always pop up. Accept myself and things the way they are. Don't force things. It's okay - I am good enough. It's okay whatever the outcome is. I'm not perfect and that's ok.
- **Exposure** As we do the things we fear / we don't like, we have an opportunity to increase our confidence in our ability to cope with the situations that frighten us. Notice fears, take them for what they are just do it. To make the process as easy as possible, don't think about it until you are experiencing it. Accept the pain for what it is and it'll be over before you know it.
- **Keep practicing** Often when we start to feel better, we stop using the skills that helped us get to that point. It is actually better to keep deliberately using helpful skills until they become automatic. To that extend, keep practicing mindfullness and CBT where needed.
- **Be yourself** Be the best version of yourself. Let's find ourselves and be ourselves - no need to envy or try to imitate others. 
 
## Life design
- Happy and at peace - I can do nothing for an hour and step out the race
- Well rounded person with interesting hobbies and opinions on a wide range of topics that come in handy during social conversations
- Enjoys being around others, sees friends regularly and engages in conversation (+visualize how these conversations actually go, including stating opinions and what I actually say)
- Energetic and enthusiastic in all areas of life
- A good public speaker
- More strategic and leadership at work
 
## Mindfullness
- Be more present. Observe with full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Accepting our experiences and thoughts without making judgments about them.
- Understand that the thinking mind is looking at thoughts and wants to solve them and not let them go. Instead, realize that thoughts are just thoughts, not facts and they often don't need to be solved, especially not in your head. They come and they go. 
- Instead, bring full awareness to the present moment:
 - Be mindful about what you're doing. Show interest in care whilst eating, drinking, walking, brushing teeth etc.
 - Regularly taking a pause from what we're doing and tune into our breathing, our senses, our moods how our bodies feel. Ask yourself if you're mindful in that moment. If not, take a break. 
 - Relax, look around you and just sit. Be amazed at how beautiful things are. How far we’ve come in our lives and in the universe and be grateful.
- When thoughts arise, just notice them but don't focus on them - I am not my thoughts. Refocus to your senses and your body. Go in debugging mode. Ask yourself: “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?”
- Daydream more. Place myself in the position of the character; deliberately ponder and dream about some big questions of life. 
- Bring an affirmation/reflection/visualization to the mindfulness session and think only about that topic. 
- When anxious, understand what you are anxious about and put those fears on paper (CBT) using a Thought Record. Then realize it's okay and doesn't need to be solved now. Then go on do your thing. 
- Think about relaxing all the time and make being relaxed your default state
- Key is to focus on what you’re doing at any point and not think to anything else that also needs to happen at some point in time
 
## Prepare for challenges
Imagine stressful situations in great detail. What is happening? What do you see and hear? What makes me feel stressed? As you visualize the physical reactions/moods etc. How do you feel? What are you thinking? What are you doing? Do you have body sensations? Now imagine putting your techniques into effect.
Spend several minutes imagining doing each step of your plan in detail. As you carry out each step in your imagination, pay attention to what you are doing, thinking, and feeling. How does this affect your mood? Thoughts? Behavior? Physical experience?
 
And you then perform the activities, log your experiences. This journal can help me next time I experience something challenging. And this helps gathering evidence of things going well.
 
## Hobbies
Balance my time between work, development and hobbies more. Perform hobbies for the sake of doing them only but it may require some forcing of this hobby time and even when bored, embrace the boredom and see what comes of it - get off the development train. Realize that autopilot is my default mode. When I feel like I should do something, it’s old habits that try to persuade me. The best way to break old habits is to pick up new ones and to just step away from the autopilot. That will be painful initially because our mind is trying to pull as back. The trick is to not give in. Then we gain confidence and know that we can handle it. Things to focus on for now: 
- Reading fiction
- Working out / yoga / stretching
- Cooking 
- Drawing 
- Doing nothing and experiencing the moment 
- Picking up on things out of pure curiosity
 
## Work
As a BI Manager, my north star goal is to make sure that data sits at the heart of every decision. As I become more senior, I'm dealing with more uncertainty and ambigiouty; there isn't one 'correct' wat of doing things. Between all the options, we pick something based on that we believe is the best option based on limited data. 

This causes imposter syndrome and overwhelm but it's the process that everyone goes through as they become more senior. If things are ambigious, they'd be ambigious for us all. Others might appear more confident but that's because they know how to handle this ambigiouity; they don't necessarily have the right answer, but they are resourceful to come to a recommendation and following that recommendation through. 

It's important for me to now manage my own priorities (one at a time), affirm why these projects are important, break the projects down into manageable pieces, provide recommendations without knowing the exact outcome and then following the projects through and moving on to the next. In this process, I will be out of my comfort zone and mistakes will be made. It'll be incredibly important to: 

- Own the process as much as possible - follow the process and do the prep work
- Try to enjoy the process and be enthusiastic about it all. There is overwhelm, there is lack of control, I won't know the perfect answers. It’s an exciting process that I haven't really experienced before and I believe in myself to navigate this scenario. Rather than being hard on myself and trying to control things and demanding perfection, I embrace it all
- Pause when stuck and work on something else. Always make sure I combine ambigious projects with easier wins so I can switch my mind.
- Ask for help when overwhelmed or stuck 
- Prioritize ruthlessly and simplify things (we don't have time nor care for perfection). If still too much, say no to projects. 

Becoming senior is about having overcome challenges and lessons learned and this takes time, being uncomfortable and making mistakes and all that results in increased confidence. Before we have gone through the process, we fake the confidence or we accept that we just try our best, don't know everything and embrace it all and flow in the journey 

*Data* 
- Accurate through testing in dbt 
- Reliable through meeting SLAs 
- Cost efficient through warehouse optimizations - full refresh possible or other recommendation?
- Future proof with concurrency, data science, full refreshes, more complexity and more volume 
- Scalable (changes at the source), high quality and well commented code

*Relationships* 
- Establish strong stakeholder relationships through regular catch-ups. 
- Keep track of relationships with vendors 

*Planning*
- Setting the yearly roadmap 
- Quarterly roadmap revisisions 

*People* 
- Capable of self service through good user onboarding, updates and training 
- Well supported through quick turnaround times and development updates 

*Tools* 
- Well organized Looker instance that is easy to use 
- Fast query performance 
- Be up to date on tools used and constantly look for improvements 

*Documentation*
- Technical documentation to facilitate understanding through the team 
- Business documentation explaining the data models 
- Looker FAQs 
- Looker training materials  

*Team*
- Relentless drive to improve the strategic impact of the team (tools/processes / training etc.) 
- Improve how we work: monthly sessions 
- Ticketing system and making it as effective as we can 
- Development, feedback, and coaching: standups, development sessions
 
**Balance and track time**
- Daily routine: emails, Notion Inbox, Data Quality dashboard, Redshift Dashboard
- Plan in advance what the main priorities are for the week. Set realistic expectations. Focus on high impact projects that make a great BI team. These are the longer term strategic initiatives and the hard challenges to solve. When overwhelmed or in doubt, make a list of projects, their next step, approach and timeline. Confirm with manager. Overall, the aim is to self-manage these priorities
- Work towards those activities in a balanced way making sure the most important ones are completed. When working on something challenging, timebox it and balance it with easier wins. Solve one thing at a time. 
- Keep a log of what I achieved during the week
- Maintain a balance between ad hoc, roadmap, and development
- Take regular breaks during the week. Am I working on the right thing? Can I make this easier? Am I approaching this in a good way? 

**Context and strategy**
- Know the context around what we work on as well as how our work ties in with the wider strategy and what impact the work has. Understand the scope and full span of the project rather than just jumping into the work directly. Know what things impact the business and work accordingly. Sometimes, this means you'll need to slow down. 
- Ask questions and challenge people. Understand why we do things in a certain way. Challenge on doing things differently that's more best practice. If we can't - challenge that, why not? What would change for us to do it that way? Also be clear on implications for us and why it's difficult.
- Ask stakeholders: 
  - Context: "I haven't been involved with this, can you give a two minute summary of what we're trying to achieve?" 
  - Use case and importance: "What is the use case of this and what decisions does it drive?"
- Tickets: 
  - What are we trying to achieve?
  - Why is this important? It needs impact and it needs to relate to strategy

**Requirements gathering**
- "What are you trying to achieve"? "How do you want to use this?" 
  - Always make sure the requirements are specific. If they want an analysis, what exact question are we trying to answer? 
  - If this isn't clear, don't start until it is - jump on calls
- "What is the impact of this and what decisions does it drive?" "How important is this and will it change decision making?" 
  - If low impact, deprioritize 
- "When do you need this by?" 
  - If urgent, prioritize it 
  - If not, backlog it 
- "How big a problem is this?" E.g. data is off by not much, manual work takes some time. 
  - If not a big problem and still a lot of work, deprioritize. 

**Answering questions**
- Avoid development work 
  - Did someone else already do this? Point them to those locations and people first
  - Can this be a simple solution in Looker or even Excel initially?
- Be pragmatic: 
  - If something isn't obvious but also not much impact, communicate to stakeholders and put it aside because its low priority. 
  - Think about scalability: can someone else use this again? Avoid manual spreadsheets as much as possible 
  - How would I do this in a simple way? 
  - Focus on what matters and drives the needle. It's impossible to understand every small detail - trust that this will come with time. Be comfortable saying you don't know at this stage and it's difficult. 
- Advise
  - Provide additional context that may change the output. Be an advisor towards business impact 

**Initiative during meetings**
- Always go into meetings with context of the problem at hand. If that context is missing, get it first (see Context and Strategy). Also know the high level things to look for around the problem to be solved.
- Understand my role in the situation and take ownership over that. 
  - Provide strategic context and importance to projects 
  - Steer people to a decision by asking the right questions or making the right observations - this come from the preparation done around how I would approach the problem
  - Set expectations around timelines and priorities with everything else going on.
  - Guide the meeting: focus on getting to impact quickly without getting bogged down with details.
- Speak up during these meetings: 
  - Ask whatever you want to ask. They know I’m not stupid, I’m just not as knowledgeable about this area perhaps
  - It’s not personal - it’s about doing the best for the company and it’s actually critical for me to speak up as this is what I will be paid for
 
**Management**
- Take ownership over BI. Have your opinions and provide recommendations. Don't run behind the facts and be proactive. 
- Be up to date with the tickets and inbox in Notion as well as the Tech tickets, know the team's priorities. 
- Have an idea around how you'd solve things that the team is working on when asked the question.
- Try to have them answer the questions:
  - What have you tried so far?
  - What do you think the best approach is?
  - What next steps do you recommend?
  - Did you ask the stakeholder?
- Think about whether the suggested approach is a good one from a high level - is there a simpler or more scalable way of doing things?
- When I don't know, say that and look into it
- When something doesn't work, ask them to provide an example
- In PR reviews, build an opinion on things based on best practices and instill this into the team
 
**Stakeholder relationships**
- Be confident around the scope of your role and project your own time - your job is BI manager not just fixing fires. 
  - Push back: we have a lot of projects. This is not highest priority - will work on it later - I will get back to you once I had a chance to work on it. Taking on all work with urgency will lead to an unhappy time at work
  - Set expectations: when they need to do something, set these expectations clearly and avoid taking things on myself.  
- Speaking with execs: deal with uncertainty around not knowing details - often kickoffs are required first. Things might not not to be done at all, they may sit with Tech etc.
- Keep stakeholders in the loop
  - Inform them when I'm looking into something 
  - If something will likely take longer than expected, communicate that 
  - If we are pending on tech, communicate the status of the tech work
- Build stronger stakeholder relationships - e.g. quarterly check-ins. This helps planning work, understand strategy and it helps understanding how they think.

**Approach projects**
- Spend time defining a good plan of attack that is quick to build, easy to test, easy to replicate and should help answer the question. Aim to find the easiest way of doing things. Validate the approach with others. Really think through what our options are - this comes from a deep understanding of what you want to achieve
- Always work on the highest priority projects at any given time 
- Build incrementally - don't aim for perfection from the get-go; aim for impact with speed. 
- Ask yourself what the goal is and whether it's worth solving in the first place
- Build things incrementally and make sure there is a good way to measure impact of what you're working on.
- Go step by step with regular checks during the process
- With ambigious problems: timebox understanding what can be done. 

**Communication**
- Communicate at all opportunities to increase confidence
- When communicating, focus on adding the strategy, impact and context. Why do we do certain things? How does it relate back to our strategy? What is the so what? This is true for team, stakeholder, partners, Lookerpaps communication. 
- Make sure to shoutout to people involved in the projects.
- Written communication - focus on answer first. The amount of context and how upfront the impact is communicated depends on severity of what is being done. 
  - Context: We have done X. We have done this because of X / this allows Y to do X 
  - So what: how does it relate to strategy? 
  - Impact: this changes X 
  - Additional context 
- Communication: slow down and structure - avoid umms where possible.
- Be specific in agendas

**BI vision**
- Build towards a longer term strategic vision of the BI team of becoming best in class in supporting the business with data. 
- What should we do now that isn't asked for but that will help solve future challenges or answer questions that will be asked in the future? 
- Where do we want to go towards? What will be needed in 2-5 years? What can we do now to get there?
- Start to prioritize working on this - balanced with priority projects. Less transactional, more strategy. 
  - Start reading, writing things up, speaking to other Data people. 
  - What is the recommendation? When? How? Why?
  - Start to evangelize to others 
- Sell this vision to others - get them onboard and excited and aware of what the team is working on. Sell BI with enthusiasm and an understanding of strategic impact

**Other development goals**
- Take ownerhip over data training. Assuming we keep a bimonthly session, what are the things I want to talk about next? Keep a log of these. 
- Develop to a really high level of code: high quality, scalable, fast, clean, business-focused, well commented and tested. Improve everything that doesn't look good. 
- Become a business advisor: understand what metrics matter to the business. Know their definitions and calculations. Know the different ways to calculate it and their limitations from our data model. When someone wants to answer an analytics question, I'm able to help answer that question with context and recommendations. 
- Improve on the commercial side of things. Contracts, legal, pricing, negotiation. Start collecting best practices and templates were using at work
- When changing things, ask 'What could go wrong?' then confirm whether that's the case before making a change
- Manage upwards: Clarify to Will what works and what doesn’t, where I need support or context or whether I want to do something. And keep a log of feedback I have for Will so I'm not empty handed when it comes to upward feedback reviews.
- Constantly learn from best practices. A good email, a good PR review, a good comment. Save it and learn from it. 
- Be proactive in onboarding users. Slack manager in advance asking whether new joiner needs access + if they’re willing to intro guide to Looker. Then, send the Looker docs + CC data superhero. Also, consider this entire process: how is it going to skill with more senior stakeholders starting to join the business. 
- As I become more senior, it's more and more important to keep in touch with the community and have people I can reach out to to talk about data. 
- Regularly revisit my development goals and record my career achievements 
 
**Dealing with hard challenges at work**
- The more senior I become, the harder the problems become. Get comfortable around this
- Keep the growth mindset. Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism and realize there's something to learn and be curious about solving it
- When dealing with complexities (e.g. when stuck, something looks complex or time consuming), remain relaxed at first and don't go into panic model, rushing to an outcome. When we rush to an outcome and it doesn't work, the anxiety will increase. 
- Instead, take a step back. Focus on process and work step by step.
  - Am I approaching this well? Do I have a good way of testing the data? Am I breaking it down in small steps or am I doing too much at once? 
  - Speak to a rubber duck around what your code is doing, step by step. Think about how this might relate to the issue you see. 
- Timebox trying to solve the problem. 
- If I can't work it out within the time, work on something else that is easier. Force this - otherwise achievements of the week will be lacking - lean into the pain of trying to solve the problem, this will get easier over time
- By putting it aside (going for a walk, sleeping on it, working on something else) we allow our subconscious mind to work on it. Look at it again with fresher eyes 
- After taking a step back I can’t figure it out, involve others. ‘Hey I’m stuck on X. I’ve tried a few things and I spent another 3 hours on it this morning but this is important and I don’t see any next steps. Can we look at this collaboratively?
- If things take longer than expected, then that's how it is: 
  - Communicate with stakeholders it's difficult and we need more time. 
  - If the business puts pressure, don't work there. Hard problems cannot be pushed
- Other tips 
  - Be kind to yourself
  - You know when you stop being mindful - try to take a break, continueing work will lead to worse results and unhappiness 
  - Force yourself to smile and just say: 'I love this' - take the seriousness of the situation. Remind yourself how amazing the world is and refocus on other people to lower your own expectations. 
  - Remind yourself of all the times when you successfully managed to solve problems. With the right process and patience, I’ve always been able to fix them - remind yourself of this evidence
  - Nobody demands perfection and have no expectations of perfection yourself - gradually I will increase my experience and I don't know everything perfectly - not even close. But by calmly solving problems we encounter, we can achieve a lot. And if mistakes happen, that's okay.
  - Check yourself four or five times a day, and say to yourself: "Am I making my work harder than it actually is?
  - I tend to make early decisions without having the full understanding or knowledge. Calmy work on things from the foundation and the answer will ultimately present itself. 
 
**Team meetings**
- I accept anxiety that comes and I don't identify with it (“I” am not anxious – I just experience an anxious episode). I let anxiety come, I observe it (“here comes anxiety”) whilst it passes through and eventually disappears as it takes care of itself. Let whatever happens happen. Once it happened, we'll understand. These are feelings and they cannot be controlled or fixed - even we as humans always try to. The more we identify with them, try to fight or control them, the more power we give them and the harder it gets. 
- Set realistic goals for the week and focus on executing priority projects during the week without being stuck on certain projects for too long (timebox these and combine them with easier wins). That way, you know you've done the work to the best of your ability. Realise that priorities change and some projects might turn out to be more complex. Do today's work to the best of your ability and let the future take care of itself. 
- I don't identify myself with the work I have done or will do. I hold no opinion, judgement or label of it as that means I would employ cognitive distortions. It's merely a representation of activity I carried out or plan to carry out. It has absolutely nothing to do with my identity - as the work and my job can constantly change. What myself and others think of that is a reflection of thoughts, understanding of the situation and our mood. So both praise and criticism are also no attacks to my identity. 
- Cognitive distortions: 
  - Black and white thinking: 'what I did is good or bad'. Instead, I did my best and it should mainly be good because of judgement to work on priorities
  - I magnify the importance of my work. Instead, the company has bigger worries and everyone is replaceable. They don't have the time to do what I'm working on so they're happy I'm taking ownership of it. You're not slacking and there is progress. They want you to do a good job and be a happy employee.  how much work is involved in what I work on. 
  - I project to know what others think of the work I did. In reality, they don't know what is a lot of work - they want happy employees and trust in progress. 
- To some extend it'll help to sometimes not achieve everything. It'll help me understand it's okay - I am not this perfect human being at all, nobody expects me to and I fully accept this and expose myself to it.
- Tell yourself: It’s okay. All will be well. I’ve got this
- To a large extend, the cause of my worry is that I allow time and energy for worries. If I'm busy with other things I enjoy, this will be a lot less the case.
- Actual meeting - focus on process
  - Music to help in the excitement 
  - Ground myself through breathing
  - Pump yourself up by being enthusiastic to speak about what you worked on / are working on
  - Engage in the meeting to be more present and not stuck in my head.
  - When speaking, focus on getting your points across and provide value by slowing down and breathing
  - Focus on the positives during the meetings.

**Public speaking**
- Focus on relating things back to the strategy and what impact the data has
- Realize it's there to stay and ultimately I need become comfortable doing it
- Accept the nerves for what they are: my body's response to preparing me for what's coming. They're welcome to stay - own your nerves - chin up and chest to the front. I knew I would get an increased heart beat and sweaty palms because I’ve been there before. All is well - I will get through this.
- Every presentation is an experiment: Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. Each time you try to do the best you can prepare for. Use techniques as experiments and see how they help
- Preparation
 - Practice, record yourself and mock present with others. Take notes, iterate and improve after each practice round
 - Visualize the events that can cause nerves and imagine how I respond to them
- Pre presentation
 - Stay busy to keep the mind occupied
 - Use music and movement to feed the excitement
- During presentation
 - The focus is on getting the point across. Focus on slowing down and breathing.
 
**Keeping a work life balance**
- I am not my work. I am my values, my hobbies, my loved ones, my health much more than my job so prioritize it according to the context of happiness as the main goal. To actually do this in practice, I force myself to do other things even when the habits try to pull.
- Seperate work from who I am as a person. Don’t take work personally and realize that we can ask help of others.
- Take it more easy - you cannot solve everything immediately and things will never be perfect.
- I cannot take these problems personally and I cannot be so affected by them. It might be that I get into work and 9 things are broken - trying to fix everything all the time will only lead to burnout and I won't be able to see the bigger picture and e.g. support the team.
 
## Social
I am a social creature. I'm interested in others, want to know them better and I enjoy conversation as a way of making potential friendships. In one on one conversations, I go deep into topics of interests of both parties and in larger group settings, I want to be part of the conversation and to share my thoughts and experiences because it adds value to everyone involved: people can respond to my thoughts.

**Social at work**
- The office is a social environment. When stuck in my head, step back and recenter that being good at and enjoying work is more than being stuck in my head. 
- Engage and speak with people and take the initiative in this. 
- "Hey", "How's it going", "Hey I don’t think we’ve met yet. I’m Dave. Great to meet you - what team are you working in?"

**Prepare things to talk about**
- Get to know other people, their life situation and interests. Ask them about that (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams/aspirations)
- Safe bets: 
  - Travelling
  - Books/series/films/documentaries/music
  - Pets
  - Food/drinks 
  - Sports
  - Recent world events - 'Did you hear about'
  - My experiences / anything new I discovered. Book I read, film I saw etc. 
- Listen and engage to what they say - be curious 
  - Focus on the basic questions: Who/what/where/how/why
  - Simply show emphathy: ‘That’s amazing’ ‘That sucks’
  - How did things make people feel?
  - Hook into a topic: 'that remind me of when'
  - Ask for opinions: What do you think about X? 
- Always be prepared to answer return questions - 'How are you' 'What about you?'

**I love and care for my friends**
I make sure I reach out regularly to my friends. I think about them regularly and I aim to meet. I show that I care.
 
**I want to get to know more people**
I am inheritely a social being, want to expand my circle of friends and meet people with similar interests
 
**I am interesting and people want to hear what I say**
My life is interesting - I have great friends, I have travelled quite a bit and I am working on become more an all-round person. I'm living the life I want to live and sharing my life with others is what will make it even richer.
 
**The more I open up, the more honest I am with myself which will lead to stronger relationships**
When you open up you allow others in your life. Being a closed box tends to move people away so be more open and vulnerable.
 
**I am able to handle anything that might be said to me**
Because I am confortable with who I am, I can handle questions of others and I am happy to be vulnerable. Trust in my creative capabilities to handle it. That said, people may judge, people may laugh, people may make fun of me. Such is life. Important to note is that those people are not important to me. Finally, I have the option to not open up when things become too personal and others will accept that.
 
**Whatever I say is okay**
Stop trying to be perfect and just say the things that come up without thinking whether it’s good enough. Just be you. Personal questions are personal to me, so just be vulnerable. In group conversations, it mainly doesn't matter what you say - you just need to say whatever you think as the topic will move on quickly.
Nobody demands perfection - that's just in my head. I'm not as important as to never be allowed to make mistakes. I do and I will continue to and that's okay - Expose yourself as this non perfect human being

## Rituals 
**Mornings**
Directly after waking up 
- 5 mindful breaths 
- Repeat mantras as written in Notes
