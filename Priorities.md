- Get all-round in data and be able to answer machine learning questions (either myself, outsouring or hiring)
- Get a really deep and good understanding of clickstream and marketing data (how data is collected, how to test for this, how are user IDs combined etc.)
- Become proficient at Git in a team setting between DBT and Looker
- To the extend relevant, get a good understanding of the AWS ecosystem to allow making decisions depending on the goal
- Get management experience

Work specific 
- Think through second order effects. When making assumptions, stress test them and think where they could break. 
- Just engage with people. Hey we haven’t met yet. I’m dave. Or when someone else comes in hey how’s it going? When they sit close to you also just regularly during the day
- Don;t assume you know the logic behind things when the logic isn't on the lowest level. Instead, verify. 
- Only ask questions when you can’t figure out something yourself. Default should be to be investigative yourself
- Don’t be upset about what others say just because they say something have the confidence to stick through your plan and only when you’re stuck ask for help . If something will take considerate time or you're not completely sure, sense check your approach
