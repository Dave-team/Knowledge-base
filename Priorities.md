# Priorities
This is a list of things I am actively working on to develop myself. 

## General
- The main overarching goal is happiness and the biggest win in this is having a consistent calm mind. 
- Let go of yourself and your ego. Stop thinking your that special and can't share things. Stop thinking everyone expects something perfect. Go with the flow and open your heart. 
- Accept myself and things the way they are. Don't force things. It's okay - I am good enough. It's okay whatever the outcome is. 
- Be more present. We can't change the past and we don't control the future. All we have is this very moment. 
- Go deep inside yourself and get to know you. Be confident sharing personal experiences, understand your emotions and feelings. 
- Relax and not take myself and life so seriously. Force yourself to slow down occasionally and just take it easy.
- Balance my time between work, development and hobbies more. Force this hobby time and even when bored, embrace the boredom and see what comes of it - get off the development train.
- When anxious, ask what you are anxious about and put those fears on paper. Then realize it's okay. 
- Visualize myself as: 
  - Happy and at peace - I can do nothing for an hour and step out the race
  - Well rounded person with interesting hobbies and opinions on a wide range of topics that come in handy during social conversations
  - Enjoys being around others, sees friends regularly and engages in conversation (+visualize how these conversations actually go, including stating opinions and what I actually say)
  - Energetic and enthusiastic in all areas of life
  - A good public speaker
  - More strategic and leadership at work 

## Personal growth 
**Goals**
- Pick up hobbies I enjoy doing away from the screen and do them for the sake of doing them only 
- Accept myself in public settings - both at work and socially 
- Be content and at peace when I do nothing
- Ability to slow down, relax and keep a calm mind

**Hobbies** 
- Become bored and figure out what you want to do
- Do things for the sake of them  
- Read from a wide variety of topics including fiction
- Cook a new recipe each week 
- Explore YouTube / Wikipedia / Documentaries
- Try new things - see Notion for this
- At least 30 minutes of mindfullness excercise each day

**Habits** 
With these, don't try to do all of them at once, that won't work. I've put these in order of priority. Master one habit before moving on. When moving on, ensure the highest priority habit is still implemented. 

- Before bed: Review goals / affirmations / meditation / visualization of goals and character I defined for myself 
- Each morning: Meditation session 
- Each morning: write in journal, be grateful for what I have and have done and reflect on strenghts and past successes 
- Each morning: some form of excercise or stretching/yoga
- No phone before bed: 
    - Tired enough? Sleep music
    - Not tired enough: read a book 
- No phone directly after waking up 
- 1x a week M
- Cold shower at the end of normal shower: a bit longer each time 
- Plan the week ahead on Sundays with a focus on social and experiences 
- Pomodoro technique 
- Read pages from a light physical book whenever there are a few minutes 
- Read the books that I would benefit the most from at any point in my life rather than reading books because they are on the shelves
- Take supplements and perform skincare each day

**Experiences**
I'll always to do things to experience as these experiences enrich my life. A big part of these experiences are listed in the bucket list, picking up new goals for a period and becoming better at them and travelling.

## Health
- Take supplements
- Stretch/yoga and some fitness excercise each morning to keep muscles engaged 
- Good posture 
- Breathing excercises 

## Social 
Dave is a social person. He is interested in other people, he wants to know more about them and he enjoys conversation - it's a way of making potential friendships. In one on one conversations, he can deep into topics of interests of both parties and in larger group settings, he loves to be part of the conversation and to share his thoughts and experiences because it adds value to everyone involved: people can respond to Dave and Dave feels valued and heard - he said what he wanted to say. 

**I love and care for my friends**
I make sure I reach out regularly to my friends. I think about them regularly and I aim to meet. I show that I care. 

**I want to get to know more people**
I am inheritely a social being, want to expand my circle of friends and meet people with similar interests 

**I am interesting and people want to hear what I say**
My life is interesting - I have great friends, I have travelled quite a bit and I am working on become more an all-round person. I'm living the life I want to live and sharing my life with others is what will make it even richer. 

**The more I open up, the more honest I am with myself which will lead to stronger relationships**
When you open up you allow others in your life. Being a closed box tends to move people away so be more open and vulnerable. 

**I am able to handle anything that might be said to me** 
Because I am confortable with who I am, I can handle questions of others and I am happy to be vulnerable. Trust in my creative capabilities to handle it. That said, people may judge, people may laugh, people may make fun of me. Such is life. Important to note is that those people are not important to me. Finally, I have the option to not open up when things become too personal and others will accept that. 

**Whatever I say is okay**
Stop trying to be perfect and just say the things that come up without thinking whether it’s good enough. Just be you. Personal questions are personal to me, so just be vulnerable. In group conversations, it mainly doesn't matter what you say - you just need to say whatever you think as the topic will move on quickly. 
Nobody demands perfection - that's just in my head. I'm not as important as to never be allowed to make mistakes. I do and I will continue to and that's okay - Expose yourself as this non perfect human being 

## Work
Dave is his own brand and Dave wants to be head of BI. As part of this role he needs to solve technical challenges, overcome them, work well with stakeholders, have integrity, communicate context to non technical stakeholders, provide context and relate to impact, sell his work during effective communications and present in public what great work Dave is doing. Whilst I have these ambitions, I am not my work. I am my values, my hobbies, my loved ones, my health much more than my job so prioritize it accordinly to the context of happiness as the main goal. 

Things I actively pay attention to and work on: 

**Stakeholder relationships**
- Be social. Show interest and want to get to know others and also allow them to get to know me 

**Initiative during meetings**
- Speak up during (team) meetings. 
- Understand your role in the situation and take ownership over that. When you don't know, say it. When you don't understand, ask. Know that you are there for a reason. 
- Ask whatever you want to ask. They know I’m not stupid, I’m just not as knowledgeable about this area perhaps 
- Again, it’s not personal - it’s about doing the best for the company and it’s actually critical for me to speak up as this is what I will be paid for 

**Team meetings**
- Own your job: I am technically capable, I ensure I work on the right things and I work hard. I keep the bigger picture in mind and I keep my stakeholders up to date. As long as I do that, I can have confidence that I'm doing the right things. 
- Focus on providing value: the value is in work, that I communicate. Am I not my work so I am not relevant to these communications. That said, I still am proud of the work and want to present it. 
- Don't be stuck in my own mind and focus on value. Listen attentively and just be present - ask questions, give opinions.  
- Realize whatever I do is the most important that needs to be done. Don't focus on other things that don't get done as a result - they are simply pushed back. 

**Public speaking** 
You have to identify the root of your performance anxiety. Are you worried that: You don’t know the material? You can’t answer a difficult question? Your presentation is boring? You don’t come off as expert? You look stupid? You sound unpolished? Your material doesn’t flow? Nobody will show up? People don’t understand you? The audience doesn’t care? Once you know where the anxiety is coming from, you can likely calm down more. 

Public speaking. It is going to happen and I accept my anxiety. It’s something I want to be become better at so I want to do it and now I have the opportunity. I will prepare well. I will understand my thoughts and stay optimistic. When the nerves arise, it’s okay. I knew they were coming. I knew I would get an increased heart beat and sweaty palms because I’ve been there before. All is well - I will get through this. I am enthusiastic about it, am well prepared and I survived in the past

- Take on all opportunities to further develop public speaking skills - don't shy away because you're scared of anxiety. Face the anxiety instead and over time it'll be less bad
- I want to become a good public speaker because it'll help me greatly in life and it's required for any significant next step in my career - every next step will have greater public speaking challenges so each time I present will be small compared to the next time. 
- Represent your own brand and seperate your presentation from your job. Imagine being a consultant to the company and present without my personally being associated to the job. 
- Every presentation is an experiment: Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. Each time you try to do the best you can prepare for. I know I need to speak in public and I know I struggle with it. I will feel nerves and there is some imposter syndrome. However, each time I try to prepare, do what I can control and that's it. The rest just happens and needs to be accepted - one I do, there will be a sense of calm which will automatically improve performance. 

**Solving hard challenges**
- Growth mindset: Embrace the challenges with confidence and optimism and realize there's something to learn
- Make use of available resources: ask other people at the right times
- When something doesn't work, step away from it

**Keeping a work life balance**
- Seperate work from who I am as a person. Don’t take work personally and realize that we can ask help of others. 
- Take it more easy - you cannot solve everything immediately and things will never be perfect. 

**Work towards Head of BI role**
- Visualize yourself being head of BI - you know the right things to do and those things are getting done. Keep a calm mind, take steps back to see the bigger picture and communicate with confidence. 
- Sometimes, step out the ad hoc fires to fix, projects to do mentally and look at the future and other developments instead. 

**Maintain a balance between ad hoc, roadmap, and development**
