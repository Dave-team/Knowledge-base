# Cooking 
## General
- The best way to learn to cook is just to make recipes
- Be actively involved during the process
  - Taste the raw ingredients 
  - Taste regularly during the cooking process (an onion goes through 4 different stages of taste) and think about what you taste. What changes when it simmers for longer? What happens when we add spice or salt? 
  - Take notes of the process Are you satisfied? What might you add? When you added it, what happened? What might you change next time?
  - Compare what you cook to other things you've tasted or tried in the past - having the notes to change things slightly and then record the outcome is great for this.  
  - Be mindful when eating 
- Food becomes better with love: give it time to develop. Let it simmer for long. Let it marinade for long. 

## Diet - vegetables
- Add pickles to a dish for a acidid taste
- A great way to increase veg intake is to simply roast or stir fry some veg. 
- Just save some cucumber and tomatoes on the side of a dish
- A bigger salad on the side
- Veg I like: 
  - Brussels sprouts - season is all except summer
  - Tenderstem brocolli
  - Onions (red, brown) 
  - Bell peppers
  - Cauliflower - season is January - April

## Cutting 
**General** 
- Waving/rocking motion starting from top of knife
- Hold with index and thumb on the steel  

**Onion** 
- Cut in half through root and peel
- Cut once or twice horizontally until 1 inch from the root 
- Slice in towards the root using tip of knife  
- Turn the onion and cut into dice

**Garlic** 
- Cut the root off
- Splash the garlic using the knife and peel 
- Start chopping small 

**Potatoes**
- Cut a small piece on one side to make it flat 
- Cut into slices 
- Stack slices and cut into dice 

## Tips
- Thaw meat by putting it in warm water within a ziplock bag and refreshing the water when it gets cold 
- Beef mince can be defrosted in the microwave
- Russets or Yukon golds to roast potatoes

## Organization
- Get the required ingredients out
- Do the chopping and prep work first 
- Whilst cooking, start cleaning up in between 
- Keep a prep bowl and a bin bowl 

## Flavour
- Flavour = taste, arome (sense of smell), sensory elements (texture, appearance, temperature)
- Seasoning is anything that enhances flavour
- Salt: enhances flavour and unlocks aroma
- Fat: amplifies flavour
- Acid: brightens and balances
- Heat: alters texture

**5 tastes**
- Salt
- Sour
- Bitter
- Sweet
- Savoury

**Salt** 
- Table salt makes things taste metalic
- Use koshet or sea salt
- Only use flakey salt as final garnish on a dish 

## Other
At restaurants, focus on picking foods that are hard to make at home. E.g.: 
- Pho
- Sushi
- Fried chicken
