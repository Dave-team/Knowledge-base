# Cooking 
## Preparation
- Buy all ingredients for the recipe
- Have a plan of attach. Generally, a sauce needs simmering, so: 
- Prep basics of the sauce (e.g. onions and garlic)
- Then add the meat to brown 
- Boil rice / pasta in the meantime 


## Tips
- The best way to learn to cook is just to make recipes
- Be actively involved with what is cooking - taste regularly and think about what you taste. Let it simmer for longer - taste again. Add some spices - taste again. You want to develop your palette. Taste ingredients by themselves too. What does basil taste like?
- Read and watch more about food and cooking. There are great Youyube channels
- Simmering is where the magic is at
- Marinate and allow for the marinade to be juiced up in teh meat 
- Thaw meat by putting it in warm water within a ziplock bag and refreshing the water when it gets cold 
- Beef mince can be defrosted in the microwave

## Organization 
Clean whilst cooking - put items in the dishwasher and wash dishes whilst things are happening on the hob 
Keep a prep bowl and a bin bowl 

## General
- TASTE things. What does basil taste like? What does a good tomato taste like? How does a peach taste? When safe to do so, taste your ingredients alone to learn what flavours they possess. Taste your dishes as you make them. What do they taste like now? Are you satisfied? What might you add? When you added it, what happened? What might you change next time?
- Take notes. It's hard to make progress if you don't remember what you did last time. Follow a recipe? Sticky-note (or note-book) a few things you notice when you make it and when you try it, and make a few adjustments next time. Write down what those adjustments were, and write down how it turned out.
- Eat other people's food. Do you like it? Why or why not?
- When you are eating or tasting, try to not be doing other things. If you are trying to figure out how to better make a dish, don't read the paper while you eat it, don't watch tv while you eat it. You took the time to make it special, enjoy it.
- Try new things. Once you can do basic cooking tasks, you can probably make 90% of the recipes you will come across. Don't be afraid of a braise, or a prep-intensive dish. Just follow the recipe diligently and see how it goes.
- Love your food, and cook with love. Treat your ingredients with respect.
