# Cooking 
## General
- The best way to learn to cook is just to make recipes
- Be actively involved during the process
  - Taste the raw ingredients 
  - Taste regularly during the cooking process (an onion goes through 4 different stages of taste) and think about what you taste. What changes when it simmers for longer? What happens when we add spice or salt? 
  - Take notes of the process Are you satisfied? What might you add? When you added it, what happened? What might you change next time?
  - Compare what you cook to other things you've tasted or tried in the past - having the notes to change things slightly and then record the outcome is great for this.  
  - Be mindful when eating 
- Food becomes better with love: give it time to develop. Let it simmer for long. Let it marinade for long. 

## Tips
- Thaw meat by putting it in warm water within a ziplock bag and refreshing the water when it gets cold 
- Beef mince can be defrosted in the microwave
- Russets or Yukon golds to roast potatoes

## Organization
- Get the required ingredients out
- Do the chopping and prep work first 
- Whilst cooking, start cleaning up in between 
- Keep a prep bowl and a bin bowl 

## Flavour
- Flavour = taste, arome (sense of smell), sensory elements (texture, appearance, temperature)
- Seasoning is anything that enhances flavour
- Salt: enhances flavour and unlocks aroma
- Fat: amplifies flavour
- Acid: brightens and balances
- Heat: alters texture
