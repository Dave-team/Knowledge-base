# Cooking 
## General
- The best way to learn to cook is just to make recipes
- Be actively involved during the process
  - Taste the raw ingredients 
  - Taste regularly during the cooking process (an onion goes through 4 different stages of taste) and think about what you taste. What changes when it simmers for longer? What happens when we add spice or salt? 
  - Take notes of the process Are you satisfied? What might you add? When you added it, what happened? What might you change next time?
  - Compare what you cook to other things you've tasted or tried in the past - having the notes to change things slightly and then record the outcome is great for this.  
  - Be mindful when eating 
- Food becomes better with love: give it time to develop. Let it simmer for long. Let it marinade for long. 
- Reference multiple recipes of the same thing - some might look better or are easier than others. Also look at reviews to understand what people may change things with.
- Get ideas: 
  - Cooking shows 
  - Cooking books
  - Recipe websites
  - Buy what's on sale / what looks good and design meals from there
  - Think about a restaurant - what are the main meals on the menu? Think and work from there
  - What's in season?
- Don't crowd the pan. Give each piece a little wiggle room and cook stuff in batches.

## Vegetables
- Add pickles to a dish for a acidid taste
- A great way to increase veg intake is to simply roast or stir fry some veg. Roasting veg with olive and salt will do. 
- Also smoothies - spinach, kale, banana, orange, coconut milk. 
- Just save some cucumber and tomatoes on the side of a dish
- Salads: 
  - Basic veg: cucumber, tomatoe, peppers, corn, beans, spinach. 
  - Roasted veg: onions, peppers, carrots, anything. 
  - Carbs: chickpea, lentils, roast potatoe
  - Additional coolness: feta, mozzarella, haloumi, avocado, apple/pears, berries
  - Nut/seeds: pumpkin seeds, cashwes, sunflower seeds, flax seeds. Roast these!
  - Dressing: part fatty, part acidic: honey/mustard, olive oil/ balsamic vinegar, lemon/yoghurt
  - Spices and herbs: salt, pepper and anythinh else that fits ingredients 
- Veg I like: 
  - Brussels sprouts - season is all except summer
  - Tenderstem brocolli
  - Onions (red (great raw in salads), brown) 
  - Bell peppers
  - Cauliflower - season is January - April
  - Aspargus - UK season May - July 

## Fruits
- Grapes - also nice frozen
- Blueberries - main season in summer
- Strawberries - it's a summer fruit
- Watermelon - it's a summer fruit 
- Tangerine - November to April
- Orange - season is January - March

## Cutting 
**General** 
- Waving/rocking motion starting from top of knife
- Hold with index and thumb on the steel  

**Onion** 
- Cut in half through root and peel
- Cut once or twice horizontally until 1 inch from the root 
- Slice in towards the root using tip of knife  
- Turn the onion and cut into dice

**Garlic** 
- Cut the root off
- Splash the garlic using the knife and peel 
- Start chopping small 

**Potatoes**
- Cut a small piece on one side to make it flat 
- Cut into slices 
- Stack slices and cut into dice 

## Tips
- Thaw meat by putting it in warm water within a ziplock bag and refreshing the water when it gets cold 
- Beef mince can be defrosted in the microwave
- Russets or Yukon golds to roast potatoes
- When overseasoning, add more volume (liquids such as water, wine, vinegar etc.)
- Watery sauces can be fixed by adding some cornflour 

## Groceries
Things that make cooking easier
- Frozen veg (peas, corn, mixed veg for stir fries)
- Some chopped garlic and ginger
- Dried herbs
- Plan the grocery list following the layout of the grocery store 
- As you notice you're running out of things, make a note to stock up next time 

## Herbs
- Rosemary, oregano and thyme are good baking herbs. 
- Parsley and Coriander are softer herbs and won't stand up to baking. Instead add them towards the end of cooking to get their full flavour.
- Basil should be added when the heat is off

## Spices
Consider buying them in bags in bulk and divide across small jars. 

Some spices to always have in stock: 
- Cumin
- Coriander seeds
- Turmeric
- Paprika
- Nutmeg
- Ginger
- Sumac 
- Chili flakes


## Meal planning 
- Plan ahead. E.g. need veg for a few days? Cut it all at once. 
- Free time when e.g. something is baking? Start prepping a sauce for the next day
- Great meals for meal planning:
  - Burritos
  - Roasted veg as snack or add-ons to a salad

## Organization
- Read the recipe before starting and have a rough idea of approach
- Get the required equipment and ingredients out and organised 
- Do the chopping and prep work first 
- Lay out the ingredients in the order in which they should be used
- Whilst cooking, start cleaning up in between 
- Keep a prep bowl and a bin bowl 
- Keep knives sharp 

## Flavour
- Flavour = taste, arome (sense of smell), sensory elements (texture, appearance, temperature)
- Seasoning is anything that enhances flavour
- Salt: enhances flavour and unlocks aroma
- Fat: amplifies flavour
- Acid: brightens and balances
- Heat: alters texture

**5 tastes**
- Salt
- Sour
- Bitter
- Sweet
- Savoury

**Salt** 
- Table salt makes things taste metalic
- Use koshet or sea salt
- Only use flakey salt as final garnish on a dish 
- Aim to add salt using your fingers rather than shaker so you have a better view on much you're adding 
- "if you taste it and think 'this is missing something,' you probably need more salt."

**Acid**
Adding acid (lemon juice / good vinegar (such as Moscatel wine vinegar) can really pep up a dish that tastes "flat".

**Heat**
Always let the pan heat up before adding the oil/food. The food should let out a nice sizzle as soon as it hits the pan, instead of sitting there, all cold and lonely.

## Other
At restaurants, focus on picking foods that are hard to make at home. E.g.: 
- Pho
- Sushi
- Fried chicken

## Cooking chicken
- Prepare even cuts to avoid pieces cooking unevenly
- Assuming you have cutlets and pounded them thin, next you will want to sprinkle on the appropriate amount of salt, let it sit on a plate or baking sheet at room temp while you continue prepping the rest of your meal.
- You want to pre-heat your pan over med-high heat with at least 2 tablespoons of oil in it. 
- Once that oil begins to shimmer and then you see the first wisps of smoke, it is time to add the chicken.
- After adding the chicken, you may want to turn the heat up to high, but be ready to turn it back down again if things get too dark, too quickly.
- Let the chicken cook undisturbed until the edges of the chicken begin to turn white. 
- Itâ€™s probably a good idea to rotate each cutlet 180 degrees so that they brown more evenly.
- Once each cutlet achieves a deeply browned surface on the one side, then flip it
- Now keep cooking the second side until you reach a minimum 70C internal temp. 
- Now pull each cutlet and transfer them to a warmed plate to rest for 5 minutes.
