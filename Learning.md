# Learning
## Practicing deliberately 
The best way to learn is by practicing deliberately. Key characteristict: 
- Break down what you want to learn 
- Learn either the basics or something you need to improve on until you've got this mastered. Then move on to the next thing. Always focus on the things that makes everything else easier
- Key is to have a feedback loop. Be critical on your progress and seek feedbac from others - especially negative feedback to learn from 
- Make practicing a habit that you spend lots of time on

## Learning principles
- In order to learn, we need to move chunks of information from the short term memory (‘working memory’) to the long term memory in the brain  
- Use spaced repetition with a tool like Anki. Spaced repetition is about remembering things just before we forget it. This will help remember things in the long term. Key with spaced repetition is to do it on a regular interval (e.g. make it a daily habit to review Anki each morning). Also just review notes multiple times  
- Build a regular schedule around learning something. E.g. one hour before work
- Create a roadmap of things you need to learn - a skeleton with links between them where you gradually increase your understanding 
- Combine focused and diffused modes of learning. Focused: deliberate effort and elimination of disturbance. Diffused: happens during non focused times (e.g. sleep / walking). This is where the mind makes and strengthens connections and allows for creative solutions (let the subconsious help come up with solutions and strenghten neural links)
    - Learn in chunks with breaks in between 
    - Don’t learn 3+ hours without a long break in between. You might also want to change to a different topic now 
    - Don’t pack everything in a day, spread learnings over a month 
    - When you’re struggling with a difficult problem, put it aside and sleep on it. Chances are, you know the answer in the morning 
- Revise the material often 
- Use the material in practice - apply early, apply often
- Think about the material - draw / take more notes around it and look at it from different perspectives 
- Recall what you learned often 
- Explain things to others - a good test is to teach it to a 10 year old. This really forces you to simplify your thinking 
- Racall what you learned 
- When recalling, identify gaps, fill these and recall again until mastered
- Consult multiple sources around the same topic to enhance understanding
- Use a sequence to learning 
    - Start with something hard 
    - When stuck, shift to something simpler
- Aim for understanding: you want to create a tree of knowledge where you hang different parts to the fundamental models you have of the world - the things you understand deeply. 

## Other
- Try to avoid questions too soon. Try something yourself first:
    - You’ll learn the hard way – which sticks to your memory much better
    - By postponing a question, you gather more relevant information. Spend more time thinking before asking the solution 
- The best way to get up to speed is to communicate with people. Ask what others are doing to fix issues. You’re most likely not the only one who’s ever seen things like X before
- Becoming good requires years of practice, a lot of self doubt, wanting to give up but continue to overcome obstacles as they occur
- Dealing with the temporary frustration of not making progress is an integral part of the path towards excellence. It is something every elite athlete has had to deal with. If the pursuit of excellence were easy, everybody would do it.
- Feynman technique
  - Choose a concept
  - Teach it to a child (or pretend to be teaching it to a child). 
  - Identify gaps and go back to source material. This is where real learning happens. Competence is knowing the limit of your abilities 
  - Review and simplify
- Before tackling a large subject, break it down and tackle these small pieces step by step and then combine these smaller pieces. 
- Use multiple sources around a topic and use Youtube for the right topics. 
- When you've been stuck on something for a longer while, make a note of it and put it away. 
- Make sure to not allow a lot of time between learning the knowledge and applying what you learned
