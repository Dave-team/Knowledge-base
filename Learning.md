# Learning
## Practicing deliberately 
The best way to learn is by practicing deliberately. Key characteristict: 
- Break down what you want to learn 
- Learn either the basics or something you need to improve on until you've got this mastered. Then move on to the next thing. Always focus on the things that makes everything else easier
- Key is to have a feedback loop. Be critical on your progress and seek feedbac from others - especially negative feedback to learn from 
- Make practicing a habit that you spend lots of time on

## Learning principles
- Build a regular schedule around learning something. E.g. one hour before work
- Combine focused and diffused modes of learning (let the subconsious help come up with solutions and strenghten neural links)
    - Learn in chunks with breaks in between 
    - Don’t learn 3+ hours without a long break in between. You might also want to change to a different topic now 
    - Don’t pack everything in a day, spread learnings over a month 
    - When you’re struggling with a difficult problem, put it aside and sleep on it. Chances are, you know the answer in the morning 
- Revise the material often 
- Use the material in practice - apply early, apply often
- Think about the material - draw / take more notes around it and look at it from different perspectives 
- Explain things to others - a good test is to teach it to a 10 year old. This really forces you to simplify your thinking 
- Racall what you learned 
- When recalling, identify gaps, fill these and recall again until mastered
- Use a sequence to learning 
    - Start with something hard 
    - When stuck, shift to something simpler

## Other
- Try to avoid questions too soon. Try something yourself first:
    - You’ll learn the hard way – which sticks to your memory much better
    - By postponing a question, you gather more relevant information. Spend more time thinking before asking the solution 
- The best way to get up to speed is to communicate with people. Ask what others are doing to fix issues. You’re most likely not the only one who’s ever seen things like X before
- Becoming good requires years of practice, a lot of self doubt, wanting to give up but continue to overcome obstacles as they occur
- Dealing with the temporary frustration of not making progress is an integral part of the path towards excellence. It is something every elite athlete has had to deal with. If the pursuit of excellence were easy, everybody would do it.
