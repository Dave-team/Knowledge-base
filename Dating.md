# Dating 

## Learnings
- Make my desires clear and move faster. I usually move too slow. 
- Close it. Make friends. Follow up. It is not a confidence thing. It is where I am too picky and think that everything directly is too serious. In reality it is just about having fun and good times. It’s not about overanalysing or overthinking
- Be focused on the other person, much less in your own head. 
- Take the initiative. Suggest the dates, pay for the first date 
- Love the nerves! You are preparing to get out of your comfort zone - embrace it all. 
- Remind yourself and recognize that you are going on a date with her - out of all the people who's busy messaging her, she chose to go out with you. She is obviously interested and attracted to you at some level, so use this knowledge to your advantage. Be willing to take risks; you're not here to make friends.
- Show her that you actually want to get to know her

## Mindset
- Being single means that you want to date. Dating means putting in a lot of effort with a lot of rejection and me having hard conversations and setting boundaries. When there is a relationship, it's about being a good partner, rejection and again setting boundaries. At no point in this journey are we 'done' - there will always be change we need to adapt to as part of being human. 
- It needs to be seen as a game - otherwise overthinking and rejection will quickly go to my head. It's fine if things don't work out. Just enjoy the experiences and the growth that comes with it. You get to learn different social skills, learn about different people, figure out what you like. 
- Rejection is not to be taken personal as there are plenty of reasons why people don’t want to commit and it's often not about me. 
- Dating is a thing I do on the side of me living my life. It's never a priority and once it has a effect on mental health, take a break. 
- A relationship doesn't solve anything. You're still being you, doing the things you love doing. Do what you do because you love doing it. That's way more attractive than anything else.
- It's worth being patient for the right person. Don't settle for anything less than someone who makes you feel happy, comfortable and long term. 
- Don't have expectations. That way, you can't be disappointed. 

## Lifestyle
- Nothing in life comes to you, you have to be open to things, you need to be curious and you need to active and go after what you want. You can’t set having a girlfriend as a goal. What you can do, however:
  - Go to meetups and meet new people
  - Join a book club, take a cooking, painting, dancing or music course.
  - Talk to random people when going out
  - Open to random people in general 
  - Just like to talk with girls, when going out this is very helpful because it’ll come as second nature to you. 
  - In general, the amount of social interactions can increase. It increases number of friends, they have friends, I would do activities I enjoy which increases chance of meeting likeminded girls etc. The point is to identify what YOU are interested in, esp if women will be there, and develop that about yourself.
- Stop thinking about what you want and start thinking about what you offer. Be the person who others want to be with. If you want someone who is honest and has personal integrity, be a person who is honest and acts with integrity. If you want a partner who is compassionate and kindhearted, be a person who is compassionate and kindhearted. Think about what you put into the world. Why would someone want to be with you? Develop the qualities you find attractive to attract people who have those qualities.

## Dating tips 
- The 3 fundamentals:
  - Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.
  - Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.
  - Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.
- Develop an emotional connection: 
  - Becoming aware of your own emotions, motivations, and life story.
  - Taking the lead by sharing those emotions, motivations, and life story first.
  - Sharing first creates trust and encourages her to open up and share herself in return.
  - Ideally, the more this goes on, the more personal the stories become and the deeper the emotions are by which you connect.
- Know what you're looking far. This will make decisions much easier over time 
- Be clear on your needs and wants. Tell someone they're cute and you'd wwould like to get drinks with them.
- If you genuinely like to speak with girls, everything will be much easier. Everybody just wants to have fun. Talk to them because you can have fun together. Talk to them because you are interested in meeting new people. Talk to them because life is amazing. And talk to anyone really, not just nice girls. This is KEY
- Dating is about being enthusiastic around who you are and not pretending to be someone else. 
- Kind of pretend that she's already your girlfriend in a confident, lighthearted manner. Make her feel comfortable. 
- First dates: 
  - Do something you enjoy doing. E.g. drinks + golf. Dates ideally are active and can include multiple things: start somewhere, then go for drinks 
  - Pay for the first date
  - Sit next to each other, instead of opposite each other
  - Invite someone: “I am not tired yet, shall we hang out at my place for a bit?” “Shall we go for a movie at my place?” I can make an amazing omellete – come over and I’ll make you one”. 
- If the date is not going well, just confidently make an excuse about how you have something to do (may it be call your friend, finish up some work, go to the gym etc.) and give a 15 minutes heads-up.
- If you're prompted at the end of the date whether you'd like to hang out again, just be honest and say that you didn't feel a connection, and wish them best of luck.
- Follow up after the date that you had a good time and ask if they came home safe? No need to wait long. 
- Be mindful of differences - is it okay if I kiss you now? 
- 

## Communication 
- Focus on feelings and emotions to really get to know someone - similarly, share your personal stories and feelings. And communicate in a fun way - provide opinions, viewpoints. Be curious. Focus on values, ambitions, motivations, emotions, passions, favourite things etc. Try to relate things people say to these things. Get to the connection as soon as possible. 
- Focus at least as much on statements as questions. Life is not an interview. Have fun in conversations and don't put someone on the spot too often. Connect to their points instead. Or elicit the answer - make a guess or assumption and make sure to know your reasons why you think that way. 
  - “Where are you from?” translates to: “You look like a California girl.”
  - “What do you do for work?” translates to: “You seem to be a creative person. I bet your job is interesting."
  - “How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys look like you’ve been friends for a long time.”
  - Her: I’m an artist. You: Interesting! I like that: I imagine you must see the world in a different way than most people; you must be able to appreciate beauty in more things. Where are you from? Her: Switzerland. You: You don’t look like it, but I’ve heard that people from Switzerland are quite conventional and really stick to rules and things. You look more like a bit of a rebel—just look at that hairstyle! What’s a hobby of yours?”
- When a conversation is dying, it is okay to make a relative random statement: ‘I am planning on doing more meetups”
- Be prepared to answer the what about you questions
- When it comes to conversations in the date, aim for topics which are grounded and create opportunities for personal connections: this means you want to talk about things like friends, family, travel, interests, work, school, memorable experiences, nostalgia etc. 
- Conversations have to be 50-50: do not constantly ask her question after question. As she'll respond, be ready to share something about you, and make sure that you're always introducing a new idea to the pool (e.g. if you're talking about your favourite hike, mention the friends you went with, and now both of you can easily access this topic of friends). 
- Superficial compliments about a woman’s body get zoned out, and show superficial values. Complimenting her personality, goals, career, etc shows more thoughtfulness and taste
- Examples:
  - She writes that she has been to a country in Africa. Reply about their traveling experience. Where else have they traveled. What about traveling is fun for them. Then open up about your traveling experiences. Find a common place you both would like to travel to.
  - She writes that she's looking for a guy who is self-aware. Ask them what it mean to be self-aware for them. Why is it a quality they are looking for. Point out some ways you're self-aware. Ask how they practice self-awereness.
  - Says she likes arts & culture... Ask them what does art do for them. How does it affect their emotions. Ask if they're artistic. If you're artistic bring it up and discuss your inspirations. If they're artistic ask about their inspiration.


## Online dating 
- Openers 
  - Always try to open with something that genuinely sparked your interest from their profile: if she mentions travelling, ask where her last trip was. If sports, what is the sport she prefers? Or mention that you really like the expression of her face on the 3rd picture. 
  - Another approach would be to make up a story about the girl. E.g. "Photo 3: Maria gazed over the beautiful and foggy bay wondering what was for dinner."
  - Go more creative: ‘Hey I just woke up from my former life as a pug. Ask me anything!’
  - So does this mean we’re bf and gf now?
  - Glad we matched! You have some interesting hobbies — where did you learn to develop a passion for XYZ?
- Move fairly quickly to a date and avoid constant texting. Figure out as fast as possible whether there is a match to some extend and get her number and move from the app. 
- In your dating app bio:
  - Basic info (profession, country of origin)
  - Mention things you enjoy: interest / hobbies
  - What you're looking for
  - Keep it short 
  - Make it funny and give them hooks 
- App photos:
  - First photo is a close up
  - Then a full body showing physique 
  - Photo where I’m dressed more nicely 
  - Being silly 
  - Photos need to tell a story of who I am 
  - Pic with dog?
  - Social pic as well 
- Be on the apps only when the mood is good and when you're busy. This makes you much less involved. 
- Consider a phone call before the date to see if you enjoy speaking and like their voice - "Wow, I'm really enjoying talking to you, do you wanna chat on the phone in a few hours"

## Interaction 
- Day openers
  - Hi, (sorry, this is very random but) I thought you looked cute and wanted to meet you. I usually never do this, but would you like for a drink with me? 
  - 'Hi - I'm Dave' What's your name? 
- Situational openers
  - How can they eat ice cream in winter?
  - What book are you reading?
- Girl showing interest: 
  - Get eye contact/smile - then wave/smile then open - 'Hey how's it going?'
  - If a girl approaches you, she has interest in a conversation. Talk back. 
- The essence of the opening is that you are just having fun, have confidence and actually don’t really care about what her response could possibly be. It’s saying: here’s who I am: take it or leave it. You should never expect anything in return. Essentially, you just show them your feelings and whatever happens after is outside of your control. When you don’t care about her response to what you say you can just say something that will start a conversation because what you’re there to do anyone is having fun with the people you newly met. When you’re anxious about what to say, it simply means that her response still means too much to you 
- Getting numner: 
  - When asking for her phone number, make sure it is based of similar interests. Let’s hang out sometime – what’s you number? 
  - Text her next day - "Hi it was nice to meet you." 
  - Set up a date
- Questions invoking passion: 
  - If you could wake up anywhere tomorrow, where would it be? 
  - I need a vacation – tell me, if you could… 
  - What is the one thing you cannot say no to? 
  - What are some talents you have that would surprise me?
- Touch goes a long way to showing interest too. 
  - Hug when you meet
  - High fives 
  - Hold her hand to see her bracelet 
  - Hold hands and squeeze a bit

## Other 
**Signals from girls**
*Pre -approach*
1.	Non accidental eye contact. When a girl looks even 10% longer than a stranger and especially when it happens again, assume it is non accidental. Humans focus on what they are curious about or on what is attractive. In that case, either directly approach or force a response. E.g. smile and wave/point at her and see what the response is from her side. If the response is positive approach with ‘hey how’s it going’ or ‘are you enjoying yourself?’. Even better would be something specific but to reduce the thinking, this will always do the trick and you’ll directly know whether you can progress or not 
2.	Smiling: this basically means, come and talk to me 
3.	When the girl approaches you, she has interest in talking to you. Even when she is just asking about directions, the time, etc. Take that opportunity and talk back 
4.	Proximity: when a girl is close to you while she doesn’t necessarily has to. E.g. sits next to you on an empty bus 

*Conversation signals*
1.	Excessive smiling/laughing: it means she likes you
2.	Flipping or playing with her hair: it means she likes you
3.	Dilated pupils: it means she’s attracted to me 
4.	Standing closer to you than normal
5.	Excessive eye contact: if she is hooked, that is a classic sign of attraction
6.	Prioritizing you: subtle but when she prioritizes being/talking to you over others, it is a clear signal of interest. 
7.	Asking you questions
8.	She asks your name
9.	Provides extended answers to your questions
10.	More open body language
11.	She looks at your mouth
12.	Slightly tilting her head while talking to you
13.	She is stroking her neck while talking to you
14.	Looking at you in a dreamy kind of way
15.	Asking if you’re single
16.	Using your name in a conversation

*Escalation signals / sexual interest signals*
1.	When she isolates herself with you – e.g. let’s go outside for a bit. This usually means she wants to be kissed
2.	Ditches her friends for you – your hers for a few hours or the entire night
3.	Touching you: either by herself or because you touched her, this is a clear sign she is ready to go beyond where you went thus far.
