- When I start dating again, I will face rejection tons of time. This is not to be taken personal as there are plenty of reasons why people don’t want to commit. But I need to be aware that rejection is a part of life, that it's often not personal, that I'm confident without someone and I'm confident that there'll be someone else in the future 
- - I really value being with someone. However, you also want to make sure you are with the right person and that person is worth waiting for. You cannot hurry love because you’re signing up for life
- - With all of these, as long as I become an independent happy man who has his shit together, I don't care about the relationship. This also means that I'll be able to take rejection because I date for fun and I'm ok if things don't work out. This lack of confidence would make me dependant and put the girl on a pedastral whihc isn't attractive
