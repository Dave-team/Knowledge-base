# Strategy 

## Principles
- A good strategy honestly acknowledges the challenges being faced and provides an approach to overcoming them
- A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It is like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.
- A good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies, and resources so as to accomplish an important end. Many organizations, most of the time, don’t have this. Instead, they have multiple goals and initiatives that symbolize progress, but no coherent approach to accomplishing that progress other than “spend more and try harder.”
- Strategy is realizing when an opportunity arises and then jumping on it with a good set of actions
- The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
  - A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
  - A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
  - A set of coherent actions that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.”

## Bringing in change 
What problem are you trying to solve?
-	Introduce the problem statement here. This might be well-defined ('we need to tweak the parameter of a rule from X to Y to help reduce a certain type of abuse'), or more fuzzy ('we need to invest more in paying back technical debt').
-	Focus on the underlying problem that needs to be solved, as opposed to jumping to how you will solve it.

Why should we solve it?
-	Why is this an important problem for us to solve?
-	Is it a big enough problem to solve? In companies like ours, there are more options available to us than we could ever complete. Prioritisation matters.
-	Should we solve it now, or later?
-	Provide specific data - quantitative or qualitative - wherever possible.
-	How do you propose to solve it?
-	Add details of your proposed change. This can be high-level as psuedocode and sketches of the architecture, or as low-level as Protocol Buffer and interface definitions. Decide what the context of the proposal is, and write appropriately.
-	Be explicit about what you are optimising for in this proposed solution — for example, 'we need to hit this deadline, so we'll accept the tech debt this entails'.

What other approaches did you consider?
-	In general, it's a red-flag if you haven't thought of a couple of different ways that you could approach the problem.
-	What does your proposed solution give you that these approaches don't?
-	What are they optimizing for that isn't appropriate in this case?

What could go wrong?
-	What risks does your proposed change entail?
-	How will you mitigate them?
-	How could this system fail, and what would be the impact if it did?
