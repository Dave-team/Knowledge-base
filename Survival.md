# Survival

## Fire
- Have a plan when there is a fire
- Using a fire extinguisher: 
  - PASS technique: Pull Aim Squeeze Sweep 
  - Aim for the source of the fire
- Cooking fire:
  - Goal is to deprive fire of oxygen. If fire contained within pots/pans, put on the lids. Otherwise fire extinguisher. Baking soda/sand will work as well.  
- Surviving fire in an apartment:
  - Remember that smoke rises. It also kills. Even if you can tolerate the smoke while standing, it is safer to crawl to the door.
  - Do not open the door until you have checked to be sure there isn't fire on the other side. Feel the door knob. If it is hot, the fire may be just outside your door.
  - Brace your shoulder or foot against the door and open with extreme caution. Should you be confronted with a high concentration of super-heated air or smoke, close the door immediately.
  - If the hall is passable, use one of your pre-designated escape routes.
  - Do not waste time gathering personal belongings, but shut the door and take your key.
  - Do not use the elevator. It may stall due to heat or loss of power.
  - If you must return to your apartment or remain in your apartment because escape routes are blocked, open a window slightly to let smoke escape. Do not break the window because you may need to close it if there is smoke on the outside.
  - If you must remain in the apartment, close all vents and air ducts. Wet towels and sheets and stuff them around the doors. If you're trapped, go to the balcony
  - In the event that you get stuck on an upper story of a building, hang sheets or anything large enough to capture people’s attention out the window to let firefighters know where you are. Do not attempt to make your way through the fire.
  - If your clothes catch on fire, you should immediately stop, drop, and roll: stop where you are, drop to the ground, and roll to extinguish the flames. Cover your face with your hands as you roll, as well, to further protect yourself from flames.
