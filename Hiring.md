# Hiring
## General
3 key questions:
- Are they smart? Have a casual conversation with them
 - Do they know stuff? Ask them what they’ve been thinking about and probe them on it. Do they seem to understand in detail and can they explain it clearly?
 - Are they curious? Are they asking questions about you? Are they genuinely interested? Asking follow up questions – do their questions make you think?
 - Do they learn? If you tell them something new, do they (try to) understand it or just nod and smile. They should really listen. I want to see some evidence that when they run into a situation where they don’t know what to do, they can learn and figure it out: they have a drive for problem resolution
- Can they get stuff done? Ask them about past achievements. Previous behavior is considered the most effective indicator of how a person is going to act in the future.
- Can you work with them? Do you enjoy communicating? Does the team like the person and believe there is a cultural fit? Pay attention to the little things (do they laugh, interrupts, listen well) and this is best tested during more casual conversations.
 
## Criteria
Relevant experience
- Relevant contribution and ownership to projects relevant to the role
 
Communication
- Can they explain themselves clearly? Do they follow the STAR framework? Do they talk through the thinking process? Can they break things down and explain them simply?
- How is their writing skills?
 
Desire for the role
- Interest in the role and company - shown by comign prepared with an understanding of the role and they ask good questions
- Do they get excited by the idea of having to fulfil the role we're hiring for? And are they excited by what they've done in the past?
 
Match
- Can we help them achieve their career goals?
 
## Hiring process
- Think through the assignment – what is this job to do in the next 90 days but also the next 24 months? As the hiring manager, write out a 90 day plan for the position you need to fill. This roadmap includes all the goals that the new team member will be expected to hit within the first ninety days of joining. This is critical for successful onboarding. During the interview process, share this roadmap with the candidate to make sure that she is excited about these goals.
 - Give them high impact easy tickets right off the bat ideally from the roadmap.
 - Especially work that helps give them an understanding of data across teams and allows them to work closely with and get to know some key stakeholders 
- Create an internal JD that ties in with the development framework at the company. This is to agree on salary and framework for hiring
- Set up a Job Description
- Align the JD with the recruiters - often companies use few recruiters they have experience with and can hire for culture as well
- Create a scorecard for the role (see below for notes). This is about thinking hard about how to look at the candidates. How can we qualify the skills of a candidate against the role?
- Discuss each candidate with several people who have worked with them
- Make sure the appointee understands the job and is sold on the company
- Make sure a mutual match exists
 
Interviews 
- Recruiting/Screening
- Manager Interview
- Technical interview by manager or team member.
- Team member interview focused on cultural fit. This can also be a key stakeholder who the person is expected to work a lot with
- Director or Executive focused on strategic understanding and fit around how data can help the business, career progression, cultural fit and sanity check
 
**Methodology**
Scorecard. The Hiring Manager creates a document in Drive that describes exactly what he/she wants the person to accomplish in the role. This is a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job. They must be both measurable and have an accomplish-by date.
Source. All Hiring Managers systematically source before we have slots to fill: referrals, recruiters.
Select. We conduct structured interviews that rate candidates against the scorecard that we’ve created.
Sell. Finally, we persuade the best candidates to join our team.
 
**Scorecard**
A good scorecard process translates the objectives of the strategy into clear competencies and attributes to measure candidates against. Look for the ability to do the job that is needed today. Second we look for flexibility and adaptability for what the role may become tomorrow. Also measure against the company's values.
 
*Mission*
What is the mission for the position?
The Mission describes the business problem and its solution.
Example: “The Operations Lead will create and manage a world-class department that will support every _____er by providing the environment, information, tools, training and habits they need to succeed in their role and make _____ a massive success.”
 
*Outcomes*
What are the outcomes that must be accomplished, by when?
This is what the person must get done. These outcomes should be measurable, have a due date, and there should be 3 to 8 of them (target is 5) ranked by order of importance.
 
*Competencies*
What traits/habits are required to:
1) succeed in the role? 2) fit in at _____?
This is how the person must do it. These are the behaviors that someone must exhibit in order to achieve the outcomes above.
 
Examples:
- We genuinely want to hang out with them. Interesting and Interested. Has interesting stories.
- Is interested in getting to know the stories of others.
- Organized. Personally organized. Follows the GTD method or something like it, and therefore stays well aware of all to-dos and events. Focuses on key priorities.

**Select**
*Phone screen*
The goal is to eliminate people who are inappropriate for the position as soon as possible. This screen is conducted by phone, and should not last more than 30 minutes. Preview that it will last 15 minutes, then extend to 30 during the call if the candidate appears good.
If you think this is an A player, let the candidate know that you think they’re great, and that you are open to extending this phone interview to get to know them more and answer their questions about _____.   Jump into “selling” mode.
 
If you think that the candidate is not an A player, end the call at the scheduled time (15 minutes, hopefully).  Within 24 hours, inform them that you appreciated their time but you will not be moving forward with them at this time.  “Thank you for taking the time to interview with us.  We do not feel that our needs for this role match your strengths. That being said, we will be hiring for many more roles in the future, and we hope to be able to reach back out to you again.”
 
*Selling the company*
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap and their Individual Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going.
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____ ...
 
*Topgrading Interview*
The goal is to understand the candidate’s story and patterns. They are predictive of their future performance. Start from the beginning and move forward chronologically. Create chapters of a job or group of jobs that last 3-5 years.
 
“Thank you for visiting us today. We are going to do a chronological interview and walk through each job you’ve had. For each job, I am going to ask you 5 core questions.
- What were you hired to do? You are trying to create a picture of what their scorecard was, if they had one. What were their mission and key outcomes?
- What accomplishments are you most proud of? Hopefully these accomplishments will match the outcomes described in the first question.
- What were some low points during that job? If they don't answer - reframe the question - what would your team members or managers say some low points were?
- Who were the people you worked with? Ask what it was like working with them.
- Why did you leave that job? Was the candidate promoted, recruited or fired? Get very curious about why?
 
*Focused interview*
This is a chance to involve other team members, and get more specific information about the candidate. This interview is focused on the outcomes and competencies of the scorecard. Get curious after every answer by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework
 
The script:
1. Now we are going to talk about ___________ (fill in the blank with the next Outcome or Competency to be reviewed).
2. What are your biggest accomplishments in this area during your career?
3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?
 
*Reference interviews*
When you're near the end of the interview process, ask the candidate for 3-5 references. Ask for the list to contain people they've worked with in different relationships (a manager, a direct report, a peer, etc.), and ideally in different contexts within a company or at different companies.
 
The script:
- Thank them for taking the time. Quickly explain what your business does, and give a little background on your stage and the general state of affairs.
- Tell them about the role you're recruiting for. Describe what you think the job will be like, why you're hiring it, and what kind of person you think you're looking for.
- I start by asking them to tell me about how they know the candidate, in what capacity did they work together, and a bit of context on the nature of their working relationship.
- Then I ask specific questions based on 1-3 areas where I most want to learn more. This might be ability to thrive in a startup environment, cultural / stylistic questions, management ability, technical proficiency, or whatever else. I usually pick a small number of areas so I can ask about each topic in multiple ways, kind of like those surveys where you're asked nearly the same question over and over. It feels strange when you're asking these, but it really does help get you closer to the truth.
- Wrap up by asking general questions to try and gauge how strongly they feel about the candidate. Questions like, "Is this person in the top half, quarter, or decile of everyone you've worked with?" or "Do you think we would be crazy to pass on this candidate?" or "If you were starting a new company or team would this person be your first hire for the role?" are good types of questions to help you get a sense of whether the person thinks the candidate is solid, great, or truly exceptional.
- Other potential questions:
 - What were the person’s biggest strengths?
 - What were the person’s biggest areas for improvement back then? It is very important to say “back then.” This liberates people to talk about real weaknesses, assuming that the candidate has improved them by now. (In reality, past performance is an indicator of future performance.
 - How would you rate his/her overall performance in that job on a scale of 0-10? What about his/her performance causes you to give that rating?
 - The person mentioned that he/she struggled with ________ in that job. Can you please tell me more about that?
 
*Selection*
Skill-Will Bull’s Eye.  We only choose candidates whose skill (what they can do) and will (what they want to do) matches our scorecard. 
 
*Negotitation*
"If we make you the following offer (explain every detail of the offer including benefits, etc), would you accept?”  Go back and forth until you have a verbal agreement.
If you skip this step, and simply make them the offer, then it is very common for them to ask for a few more things after-the-fact (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc). 
You will then be in the awkward position of either having to give these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin), or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. 
It is far better to get the candidate to pre-agree in full detail before making the offer.  Then the relationship begins with a resoundingly positive “Yes! Thank you! I’m so excited!”
 
## Interview principles
- Strong interviewers need to have flexible questions that react to signals from the candidates. If candidates signals weak analytical skills and the job requires it, then the interviewer needs to double down and dig into the harder parts of their questions. If there’s signal for weak communication, then then interviewer needs to start giving ambiguous problems and see how the candidate can get clarification.
- Interviews must end on a positive note. Its an incredibly vulnerable experience for candidates, and there’s no easier way to burn goodwill and gain a reputation than to have asshole interviewers. We all know which companies are assholes. It doesn’t take much to receive this label.
- Communicate the vision of the company and what team/role the people will be part of. The best people are looking for challenges.
- Redirect the conversation as needed - you are in charge of keeping the conversation focused and timely
- Reference questions:
 - What was it like working with them?
 - Would they hire them again?
 
**Interviewing well**
It is important to go deeper. Throughout the interview, get curious. Ask follow-up questions that start with “What”, “How” or “Tell me more.” Especially with behavoutial questions, we want to detail the exact contributions a candidate has made to an effort which led to results. The key to go deeper is to ask What, Why, How, and Who at each step of the process. This will let the candidate paint a very clear picture of the situation, their ownership of the idea/solution, and their decision process in key pivotal moments.
 
Make sure to repeat the important things they say about their goals, challenges, and ideal solutions back to them to show them that you are listening and build trust. Often, we need to interpret what the candidate says rather than demanding they explain it better. Tell the candidate what you understood, repeat the story, and let them correct you as needed.
 
Examples:
- “What do you mean?”
- "What is an example of that?”
- “How did you do that?”
- “How did that feel?”
- "Please tell me more".
 
**Interrupt**. Do so tactfully. But do not let a candidate ramble. Doing so will only hurt their chances of success, because it will chew up valuable time without conveying important information. Expect to interrupt the candidate once every 3-4 minutes.
The proper way to interrupt someone is to be positive and use reflective listening: “Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!” The candidate says: “Yes.” Then you immediately say: ”You were telling me earlier about launching that email campaign. I’d love to hear what that was like? How well did it go?”
 
**Three Ps**. Use the 3 Ps to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in context.
- How did your performance compare to the previous year’s performance?
- How did your performance compare to the plan?
- How did your performance compare to that of your peers?
 
**Push versus Pull**. People who perform well are generally pulled to greater
opportunities. For each job change, determine if it was a push or a pull.
Push. “It was mutual.” “It was time for me to leave.”
Pull. “My biggest client hired me.” “My old boss recruited me to a bigger job.”
 
**Painting a Picture**. You’ll know that you understand what a candidate is saying when you can literally see a picture of it in your mind. Put yourself in their shoes.
 
**Stopping at the Stop Signs**. If you see or hear inconsistencies, the candidate may be telling an untruth. If this happens, get curious, and dig deeper. Think of yourself as a biographer (positive), not an investigative journalist (negative).
 
## General
- If you do have a unicorn in your pipeline, speed is crucial. These candidates stay on the market for as little as 10 days, so wasting no time and pushing them through is necessary to close.
- Look at own networks before you look outside for new people to hire
- To get good people, you might need to poach. Good people are never looking for jobs
- Plan out interview questions with the team ahead of time
- Ask candidates if there is anyone else they want to talk to in the company - other teams they're interested in, folks who have been at the company a long time and might have a unique view of things, etc. Similarly, allow candidates to interview yourself for 30 minutes
- When hiring people, make sure to test them on the actual work they’ll be doing
- The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person.  Making a big deal out of it is a good thing.  We recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Make it memorable.
- Notes:
 - Take notes during a interview:
   - Key take-aways
   - Notes for other interviewers: e.g. specifying areas to dig into, further evaluate, or look out for.
   - Pros and cons
 - Share these notes and store them centrally after an interview - document them quickly after an interview
 
## Interview questions
Behaviour questions - look for STAR - What was the situation and how did you handle it?
- Tell me of a time you were under strong pressure.
- Tell me about a time when you realized that you built something and you realized the data is wrong afterwards. What did you do to fix this issue? (Look for: how did they communicate, how did they solve the root cause, how would they present the final improved results) 
- A stakeholder wants something done by tomorrow but your to-do list is already full - what are your next steps?
- A stakeholder creates a ticket but you don't really understand the ask. What are your next steps?
- What are some of the challenges you have had to deal with?
- Describe a situation when you didn’t agree with something
- Describe a situation when you had to deal with negative feedback
- Tell me about a time that you disagreed with a coworker (a manager, a peer, someone from another department, etc.). What was the situation, and what did you do to resolve the conflict?
- Describe a time you’ve had someone question your analytic work. How did you explain your process and reasoning?
- Tell me a time when you were caught off guard (eg. fire drill project). What was it and how did you handle it?
- Tell me about a time you presented an analysis that you thought would lead to meaningful impact, but did not. Why do you think it didn't convince the stakeholders? What would you have done differently?
- Explain a time when someone questioned your data.
- Tell me about a project you screwed up and the consequences for the different stakeholders involved. What do you differently now as a result, and how does that impact each of those stakeholders.

Hi X - How are you?
Thanks for taking the time today. This will be a quick call to speak a bit to Papier, myself and the role. I'll then ask a few questions to understand your background and get a feel for what you're looking for. In the end, we'll have some time left for any questions you may have. Sound good?
 
Great. So Papier is a fast-growing ecommerce business delivering beautifully designed stationairy products, such as personalised greeting cards and stationery. We were founded in 2015 and we're now about 70 people with a beatiful office in Camdem. We have a very data driven culture with over 75% of the business using Looker on a weekly basis. I joined the business back in July as a BI Manager and we're now looking for someone who can come in and develop data solutions that enable decision making at Papier. We're a very small BI team so you'll have the opportunity to support different teams across diverse data sets.
 
This is a very high level overview - do you have any questions on that so far?
 
Ok I'd like to know a bit more about you - can you tell a bit about yourself? (I'm really looking for the storyline of the career - what jobs you had, why you choose them, high level what you did)
 
Questions to ask during the body of the interview?
- What type of projects were you involved with at X? What type of data was involved in these?
- What tools did you work with? Like / dislike? (potentially other questions around tooling)
- What are you looking for?
- Why do you want to leave X?
- Why did you apply to this role in particular?
- What is your notice period?
- What are your salary expectations?
 
Ok great - Do you have any questions for me?
 
Great. We will go back and discuss internally. FYI - if there is a fit, the next step is a technical test for you to do. Then there's a more in depth interview and if all goes well, there will be a final interview with an executive.
 
Thanks again for your time today!
 
## Technical test 
Ideas
- Google Doc: orders, products with some null values in the data
 - Group by
 - Window function
 - Join with null
 - Some true/false columns with nulls - do they filter on false or null?
- Here’s a bad query, how would you refactor it?
 
Principles
- Give potential hires a real life project to work on - potentially something that you've answered previously so they understand what a real life task can look like
- Consider
 - Use BigQuery / Mode to work with data with a free account
 - Also can think about Coderpad and CodeSubmit.io
 - Simple Google Doc in which they write queries in plain text
 
What to look for
- don’t focus on the outcome/tools but rather their communication and problem solving. Why they made certain decisions and then try to further challenge their reasoning during the interview itself.
- do they understand things first. E.g. do they understand business importance and can they put themselves in the stakeholder's shoes?
- do they ask questions
- are they critical and creative
- do you show an understanding
- do they write good code
- do they think about comments and reproducability
- In short, did the candidate:
 - Frame the problem
 - Define constraints
 - Clarify the goal
 - Solve the problem
 
The most important part of the technical test is the discussion about the test post interview.
