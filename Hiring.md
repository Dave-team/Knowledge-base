# Hiring 

Objective: To answer the question: can I actually work with this person?
This is mainly done by having a casual conversation and partly to test someone’s skills, mainly determined by asking questions about what the person has done in the past.

3 key questions: 
- Are they smart? Have a casual conversation with them
  - Do they know stuff? Ask them what they’ve been thinking about and probe them on it. Do they seem to understand in detail and can they explain it clearly? 
  - Are they curious? Are they asking questions about you? Are they genuinely interested? Asking follow up questions – do their questions make you think? 
  - Do they learn? If you tell them something new, do they (try to) understand it or just nod and smile. They should really listen 
- Can they get stuff done? Ask them about past achievements. 
- Can you work with them? Do you enjoy communicating? Does the team like the person and believe there is a cultural fit? Pay attention to the little things (do they laugh, interrupts, listen well)

Criteria
Relevant experience 
- Relevant contribution and ownership to projects relevant to the role

Communication 
- Can they explain themselves clearly? Do they follow the STAR framework? Do they talk through the thinking process?
- How is their writing skills?

Desire for the role 
- Interest in the role and company - shown by comign prepared with an understanding of the role and they ask good questions 
- Do they get excited by the idea of having to fulfil the role we're hiring for? 

Match 
- Can we help them achieve their career goals? 

## Hiring process 
- Think through the assignment – what is this job to do in the next 90 days but also the next 24 months?
- Think hard about how to look at the candidates. What are the strengths of the candidate and are these the right strengths for the assignment? 
- Discuss each candidate with several people who have worked with them 
- Make sure the appointee understands the job and is sold on the company 
- Make sure a mutual match exists

In the last round of data analyst hiring I did, we had
Recruiting/Screening
Manager Interview
Team member interview, which included a technical assessment
Team member interview
Director or Executive

## Interview principles
- Strong interviewers need to have flexible questions that react to signals from the candidates. If candidates signals weak analytical skills and the job requires it, then the interviewer needs to double down and dig into the harder parts of their questions. If there’s signal for weak communication, then then interviewer needs to start giving ambiguous problems and see how the candidate can get clarification.
- Interviews must end on a positive note. Its an incredibly vulnerable experience for candidates, and there’s no easier way to burn goodwill and gain a reputation than to have asshole interviewers. We all know which companies are assholes. It doesn’t take much to receive this label.


## General
- If you do have a unicorn in your pipeline, speed is crucial. These candidates stay on the market for as little as 10 days, so wasting no time and pushing them through is necessary to close.
- Interview panel
  - Have one technical person assess the technical competence
  - Have most of the interview panel comprised of other execs who are all focused on figuring out whether this person understands how data fits into their world. This can span from a head of sales having a convo on the ways data can tactically and strategically help their team be efficient and land deals, to the CEO being able to have a CEO-level convo on how data fits into the broader strategy.
- Adjusting questions should be done in between the different panels as well. Interviewers need to be fast with putting their notes, so that the next interviewer has time to adjust their questions.
- Copious notes should be taken and shared. This reduces the chance that at the end of 6 interviews, we still have gaps in evaluating the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at own networks before you look outside for new people to hire 
- To get good people, you might need to poach. Good people are never looking for jobs
- Plan out interview questions with the team ahead of time
I always ask candidates if there is anyone else they want to talk to in the company - other teams they're interested in, folks who have been at the company a long time and might have a unique view of things, etc.
I give them 30 mins to interview me and offer them the opportunity to speak with anyone they'd like

## Technical test 
- Use BigQuery / Mode to work with data with a free account 
- Also can think about Coderpad and CodeSubmit.io
- Give potential hires a real life project to work on and don’t focus on the outcome but rather their write up about why they made certain decisions and then try to further challenge their reasoning during the interview itself 
here’s a bad query, how would you refactor it?
here’s a monolithic query, how would you break it up into a dbt project?

Personally, I prefer to avoid testing knowledge of specific tools and rather test problem solving and learning.
With that in mind I wrote a tech test last year for candidates that helped them set up dbt in a Docker container with a local Postgres DB (i.e. all prebuilt with step by step instructions and seed data), and then asked them to develop a few basic models, consecutively more difficult, with skeleton SQL files in place for each stage (including instructions and CTE imports, so dbt syntax wouldn’t need to be learnt immediately). The emphasis was on them writing SQL and making decisions about (slightly) messy data, and the challenge was framed as such.

In short, did the candidate:
Frame the problem
Define constraints
Clarify the goal
Solve the problem

You can find free tools that will allow someone to work on a real dataset (e.g. Big Query public data sets + free tiers of several tools), or you can just ask them to write it in a doc. There are tradeoffs either way - real tools give you error feedback, but also may require someone to adjust to a new syntax that might throw them off (esp. at an associate level, many folks have only worked with one dialect).

I think you could easily do a data modeling exercise as a take home and then discuss choices/tradeoffs/modifications during the interview.
