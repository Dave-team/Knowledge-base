Interview panel
Have one technical person assess the technical competence
Have most of the interview panel comprised of other execs who are all focused on figuring out whether this person understands how data fits into their world. This can span from a head of sales having a convo on the ways data can tactically and strategically help their team be efficient and land deals, to the CEO being able to have a CEO-level convo on how data fits into the broader strategy.

Evaluating canditates
For experienced candidates, we look at the types of teams that they worked in. Did they work at companies with strong engineering or data orgs? What types of projects did they take on? Are they relevant? If not, were they challenging? How much impact did they have at previous roles?

General
But if you do have a unicorn in your pipeline, speed is crucial. These candidates stay on the market for as little as 10 days, so wasting no time and pushing them through is necessary to close.

Being a good interviewer
Strong interviewers need to have flexible questions that react to signals from the candidates. If candidates signals weak analytical skills and the job requires it, then the interviewer needs to double down and dig into the harder parts of their questions. If there’s signal for weak communication, then then interviewer needs to start giving ambiguous problems and see how the candidate can get clarification.
Adjusting questions should be done in between the different panels as well. To get hired at Wish, candidates have to go through 1–2 phone screens, and 4 onsite interviews. Interviewers need to be fast with putting their notes, so that the next interviewer has time to adjust their questions.
Copious notes should be taken and shared. This reduces the chance that at the end of 6 interviews, we still have gaps in evaluating the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses.
Interviews must end on a positive note. Its an incredibly vulnerable experience for candidates, and there’s no easier way to burn goodwill and gain a reputation than to have asshole interviewers. We all know which companies are assholes. It doesn’t take much to receive this label.

Interview questions
Tell me about the most challenging analytical project you’ve handled on your own Things I would look for would be:
- How did you come across the problem
- How did you structure the solution
- How did you collect the data and validate it
- What tools did you use to build the solution? Can be excel or tableau. Doesn’t matter as long as the appropriate tool is used
- Talk to me about the underlying math or logic
- What challenges did you face and how did you over come them
- How did you present to your stakeholders
- How did it impact the business


Tell me about a time you presented an analysis that you thought would lead to meaningful impact, but did not. Why do you think it didn't convince the stakeholders? What would you have done differently?
 
Tell me about a time when you realized after the fact that you made some very incorrect assumptions about the data. What did you do to fix this issue? How did you communicate the problem to people who had received the analysis already?
