# Hiring 

Reflections Papier process
- Company wants to use fewer agencies and just those we know and trust 
- Simon helps recruiter contacts, putting the ad online. 
- We screen CVs ourselves 
- Internal JD helps to agree on salary, agree on framework for hiring. Also part of PD 

## General
You hire people who can get the job done. The industry overvalues experience and undervalues strategic and intellectual flexibility. The important lesson is you don’t hire generic people — you hire people who have had some sort of stress, or achievement, or something. The best people to hire are CFO’s who have gone bankrupt — these people have gone through the ware. 
 
Hiring decisions are crucial: 
- 4-5 months of salary
- Hiring / recruiter costs
- People need to train these new hires
- New hires are unproductive at first 

Objective: To answer the question: can I actually work with this person?
This is mainly done by having a casual conversation and partly to test someone’s skills, mainly determined by asking questions about what the person has done in the past.

3 key questions: 
- Are they smart? Have a casual conversation with them
  - Do they know stuff? Ask them what they’ve been thinking about and probe them on it. Do they seem to understand in detail and can they explain it clearly? 
  - Are they curious? Are they asking questions about you? Are they genuinely interested? Asking follow up questions – do their questions make you think? 
  - Do they learn? If you tell them something new, do they (try to) understand it or just nod and smile. They should really listen. I want to see some evidence that when they run into a situation where they don’t know what to do, they can learn and figure it out: they have a drive for problem resolution 
- Can they get stuff done? Ask them about past achievements. 
- Can you work with them? Do you enjoy communicating? Does the team like the person and believe there is a cultural fit? Pay attention to the little things (do they laugh, interrupts, listen well)

Criteria
Relevant experience 
- Relevant contribution and ownership to projects relevant to the role

Communication 
- Can they explain themselves clearly? Do they follow the STAR framework? Do they talk through the thinking process?
- How is their writing skills?

Desire for the role 
- Interest in the role and company - shown by comign prepared with an understanding of the role and they ask good questions 
- Do they get excited by the idea of having to fulfil the role we're hiring for? 

Match 
- Can we help them achieve their career goals? 

## Hiring process 
- Think through the assignment – what is this job to do in the next 90 days but also the next 24 months?
  - Give them high impact easy tickets right off the bat ideally from the roadmap. 
  - Especially work that helps give them an understanding of data across teams.  
  - Avoid doing all the work in the roadmap between ourselves 
- Think hard about how to look at the candidates. What are the strengths of the candidate and are these the right strengths for the assignment? 
- Discuss each candidate with several people who have worked with them 
- Make sure the appointee understands the job and is sold on the company 
- Make sure a mutual match exists

In the last round of data analyst hiring I did, we had
Recruiting/Screening
Manager Interview
Team member interview, which included a technical assessment
Team member interview
Director or Executive

**Methodology** 
Scorecard. The Hiring Manager creates a document in Drive that describes exactly what he/she wants the person to accomplish in the role. This is a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job. They must be both measurable and have an accomplish-by date.
Source. All Hiring Managers systematically source before we have slots to fill: referrals, recruiters.
Select. We conduct structured interviews that rate candidates against the scorecard that we’ve created.
Sell. Finally, we persuade the best candidates to join our team. 

**Scorecard**
A good scorecard process translates the objectives of the strategy into clear outcomes for the Exec Team, which then translates their outcomes into clear outcomes for those who report to them, etc. Every _____er ends up with a set of outcomes that support the strategy, and competencies that support the outcomes and culture. First we look for the ability to do the job that is needed today. Second we look for flexibility and adaptability for what the role may become tomorrow. 

*Mission*
What is the mission for the position? 
The Mission describes the business problem and its solution. 
Example: “The Operations Lead will create and manage a world-class department that will support every _____er by providing the environment, information, tools, training and habits they need to succeed in their role and make _____ a massive success.” 

*Outcomes* 
What are the outcomes that must be accomplished, by when? 
This is what the person must get done. These outcomes should be measurable, have a due date, and there should be 3 to 8 of them (target is 5) ranked by order of importance. 

*Competencies* 
What traits/habits are required to: 
1) succeed in the role? 2) fit in at _____? 
This is how the person must do it. These are the behaviors that someone must exhibit in order to achieve the outcomes above. 

Examples:
- We genuinely want to hang out with them. Interesting and Interested. Has interesting stories. 
- Is interested in getting to know the stories of others. 
- Organized. Personally organized. Follows the GTD method or something like it, and therefore stays well aware of all to-dos and events. Focuses on key priorities. 
- Sense of Urgency. Fights against an organization’s natural state: inertia. Knows that to build something great we all need to move mountains, now!
- Innovative. Seeks to make process improvements to make their role and _____ more efficient going forward. 
- Collaborative. Reaches out to peers and cooperates with managers to establish an overall collaborative environment. 
- Persuasive. Able to convince others to pursue a course of action. Coachable. Wants to improve; open to feedback; acts on that feedback. 
- Coachable. Wants to improve; open to feedback; acts on that feedback.

**Select**
*Phone screen*
The goal is to eliminate people who are inappropriate for the position as soon as possible. This screen is conducted by phone, and should not last more than 30 minutes. Preview that it will last 15 minutes, then extend to 30 during the call if the candidate appears good. 

Set expectations:
“Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I’d like to spend the first 10 minutes of our call getting to know you. After that, I’m happy to answer any questions you have about us. Sound good?” 

If you think this is an A player, let the candidate know that you think they’re great, and that you are open to extending this phone interview to get to know them more and answer their questions about _____.   Jump into “selling” mode.

If you think that the candidate is not an A player, end the call at the scheduled time (15 minutes, hopefully).  Within 24 hours, inform them that you appreciated their time but you will not be moving forward with them at this time.  “Thank you for taking the time to interview with us.  We do not feel that our needs for this role match your strengths. That being said, we will be hiring for many more roles in the future, and we hope to be able to reach back out to you again.”

*Selling the company*
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap and their Individual Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going. 
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____ ...

*Topgrading Interview*
The goal is to understand the candidate’s story and patterns. They are predictive of their future performance. Start from the beginning and move forward chronologically. Create chapters of a job or group of jobs that last 3-5 years. 

“Thank you for visiting us today. We are going to do a chronological interview and walk through each job you’ve had. For each job, I am going to ask you 5 core questions. 
- What were you hired to do? You are trying to create a picture of what their scorecard was, if they had one. What were their mission and key outcomes?
- What accomplishments are you most proud of? Hopefully these accomplishments will match the outcomes described in the first question.
- What were some low points during that job? If they don't answer - reframe the question - what would your team members or managers say some low points were?
- Who were the people you worked with? Ask what it was like working with them. 
- Why did you leave that job? Was the candidate promoted, recruited or fired? Get very curious about why? 

*Focused interview*
This is a chance to involve other team members, and get more specific information about the candidate. This interview is focused on the outcomes and competencies of the scorecard. Get curious after every answer by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework 

The script:
1. Now we are going to talk about ___________ (fill in the blank with the next Outcome or Competency to be reviewed). 
2. What are your biggest accomplishments in this area during your career? 
3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area? 

*Reference interviews*
The script: 
1. In what context did you work with the person? 
2. What were the person’s biggest strengths? 
Get curious by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework.
3. What were the person’s biggest areas for improvement back then?
It is very important to say “back then.” This liberates people to talk about real weaknesses, assuming that the candidate has improved them by now. (In reality, past performance is an indicator of future performance.)
4. How would you rate his/her overall performance in that job on a scale of 0-10? What about his/her performance causes you to give that rating?
5. The person mentioned that he/she struggled with ________ in that job. Can you please tell me more about that? 

*Selection* 
Skill-Will Bull’s Eye.  We only choose candidates whose skill (what they can do) and will (what they want to do) matches our scorecard.  

## Interview principles
- Strong interviewers need to have flexible questions that react to signals from the candidates. If candidates signals weak analytical skills and the job requires it, then the interviewer needs to double down and dig into the harder parts of their questions. If there’s signal for weak communication, then then interviewer needs to start giving ambiguous problems and see how the candidate can get clarification.
- Interviews must end on a positive note. Its an incredibly vulnerable experience for candidates, and there’s no easier way to burn goodwill and gain a reputation than to have asshole interviewers. We all know which companies are assholes. It doesn’t take much to receive this label.
- Communicate the vision of the company and what team/role the people will be part of. The best people are looking for challenges. 
- Reference questions: 
  - What was it like working with them?
  - Would they hire them again? 

**Interviewing well**
It is important to go deeper. Throughout the interview, get curious. Ask follow-up questions that start with “What”, “How” or “Tell me more.” 

Make sure to repeat the important things they say about their goals, challenges, and ideal solutions back to them to show them that you are listening and build trust. 

Examples:
- “What do you mean?”
- "What is an example of that?” 
- “How did you do that?”
- “How did that feel?”
- "Please tell me more". 

**Interrupt**. Do so tactfully. But do not let a candidate ramble. Doing so will only hurt their chances of success, because it will chew up valuable time without conveying important information. Expect to interrupt the candidate once every 3-4 minutes.
The proper way to interrupt someone is to be positive and use reflective listening: “Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!” The candidate says: “Yes.” Then you immediately say: ”You were telling me earlier about launching that email campaign. I’d love to hear what that was like? How well did it go?” 

**Three Ps**. Use the 3 Ps to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in context. 
- How did your performance compare to the previous year’s performance? 
- How did your performance compare to the plan?
- How did your performance compare to that of your peers? 

**Push versus Pull**. People who perform well are generally pulled to greater 
opportunities. For each job change, determine if it was a push or a pull.
Push. “It was mutual.” “It was time for me to leave.”
Pull. “My biggest client hired me.” “My old boss recruited me to a bigger job.” 

**Painting a Picture**. You’ll know that you understand what a candidate is saying when you can literally see a picture of it in your mind. Put yourself in their shoes.

**Stopping at the Stop Signs**. If you see or hear inconsistencies, the candidate may be telling an untruth. If this happens, get curious, and dig deeper. Think of yourself as a biographer (positive), not an investigative journalist (negative). 

## General
- If you do have a unicorn in your pipeline, speed is crucial. These candidates stay on the market for as little as 10 days, so wasting no time and pushing them through is necessary to close.
- Interview panel
  - Have one technical person assess the technical competence
  - Have most of the interview panel comprised of other execs who are all focused on figuring out whether this person understands how data fits into their world. This can span from a head of sales having a convo on the ways data can tactically and strategically help their team be efficient and land deals, to the CEO being able to have a CEO-level convo on how data fits into the broader strategy.
- Adjusting questions should be done in between the different panels as well. Interviewers need to be fast with putting their notes, so that the next interviewer has time to adjust their questions.
- Copious notes should be taken and shared. This reduces the chance that at the end of 6 interviews, we still have gaps in evaluating the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at own networks before you look outside for new people to hire 
- To get good people, you might need to poach. Good people are never looking for jobs
- Plan out interview questions with the team ahead of time
I always ask candidates if there is anyone else they want to talk to in the company - other teams they're interested in, folks who have been at the company a long time and might have a unique view of things, etc.
I give them 30 mins to interview me and offer them the opportunity to speak with any
-	When hiring people, make sure to test them on the actual work they’ll be doing 
- "If we make you the following offer (explain every detail of the offer including benefits, etc), would you accept?”  Go back and forth until you have a verbal agreement. If you skip this step, and simply make them the offer, then it is very common for them to ask for a few more things after-the-fact (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc).  You will then be in the awkward position of either having to give these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin), or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no.  It is far better to get the candidate to pre-agree in full detail before making the offer.  Then the relationship begins with a resoundingly positive “Yes! Thank you! I’m so excited!”
- The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person.  Making a big deal out of it is a good thing.  We recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Make it memorable. 
- 90 days plan: As the hiring manager, write out a ninety-day roadmap for the position you need to fill. This roadmap includes all the goals that the new team member will be expected to hit within the first ninety days of joining. This is critical for successful onboarding. During the interview process, share this roadmap with the candidate to make sure that she is excited about these goals.

- Use BigQuery / Mode to work with data with a free account 
- Also can think about Coderpad and CodeSubmit.io
- Give potential hires a real life project to work on - potentially something that you've answered previously so they understand what a real life task can look like


What to look for 
- don’t focus on the outcome but rather their write up about why they made certain decisions and then try to further challenge their reasoning during the interview itself. 
- do they understand things first. E.g. do they understand business importance and can they put themselves in the stakeholder's shoes?
- do they ask questions
- are they critical and creative
- do you show an understanding 
- do they write good code
- do they think about comments and reproducability 



here’s a bad query, how would you refactor it?
here’s a monolithic query, how would you break it up into a dbt project?

Personally, I prefer to avoid testing knowledge of specific tools and rather test problem solving and learning.
With that in mind I wrote a tech test last year for candidates that helped them set up dbt in a Docker container with a local Postgres DB (i.e. all prebuilt with step by step instructions and seed data), and then asked them to develop a few basic models, consecutively more difficult, with skeleton SQL files in place for each stage (including instructions and CTE imports, so dbt syntax wouldn’t need to be learnt immediately). The emphasis was on them writing SQL and making decisions about (slightly) messy data, and the challenge was framed as such.

In short, did the candidate:
Frame the problem
Define constraints
Clarify the goal
Solve the problem

You can find free tools that will allow someone to work on a real dataset (e.g. Big Query public data sets + free tiers of several tools), or you can just ask them to write it in a doc. There are tradeoffs either way - real tools give you error feedback, but also may require someone to adjust to a new syntax that might throw them off (esp. at an associate level, many folks have only worked with one dialect).

I think you could easily do a data modeling exercise as a take home and then discuss choices/tradeoffs/modifications during the interview.

New notes
3 things to look for when hiring people:
1. Are they smart?
2. Do they get things done?
3. Do I/ Can I spend a lot of time around them

You can learn a lot by an interview but work with someone is a lot better. When interviewing, really go deep into what someone has done in terms of projects. Also, make sure to call references. Really go deep: 􏰆hy are􏰂’t you hiring them, what did they specifically do? Would you say they are in the top 5% of the thing they have been working on?
