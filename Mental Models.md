# Mental Models

As you gain experience in life, many things become ‘another one of those’. This is where you need to have solid principles. You need to know the big ideas across many disciplines and study them routinely. Don’t be the man with the hammer to whom everything looks like a nail. The way to use the models is to have them apply as checklists whenever decisions need to be made

## Human behaviour
Hanlon’s razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness. When a mistake has been made, don’t take it personally and get annoyed/angry, etc. Realize that neglect and ignorance are a common thing we all have and are suspect of. When someone has certain behaviour place less emphasis on the internal characteristics (personality) of the person and focus more on external factors (situational explanations)

bandwagon effect — a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others. Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.

Groupthink: psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. 

Loss Aversion — People’s tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.

bystander effect — a social psychological phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present.

diffusion of responsibility — a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when others are present.

Pollyanna principle — tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs — Maslow used the terms ‘physiological’, ‘safety’, ‘belongingness’ and ‘love’, ‘esteem’, ‘self-actualization’, and ‘self-transcendence’ to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through

Conspicuous Consumption — The spending of money on and the acquiring of luxury goods and services to publicly display economic power.

tragedy of the commons — A situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action

Free rider problem — when those who benefit from resources, goods, or services do not pay for them, which results in an under-provision of those goods or services.

Association- We automatically feel pleasure or pain when we connect a thing, situation or individual with an experience we’ve had in the past. Or automatically connecting a stimulus with pain or pleasure; including liking or disliking something associated with something bad or good. Includes seeing situations as identical because they seem similar. If we had a good experience, we associate positively with something, we’ll want to continue doing that. You use one shoe polish, you’ll stick with that for the rest of your life. People associate high price with high quality. This is also quite dangerous as we tend to repeat things we previously had success with, even though the circumstances can have changed or is it was due to luck in the first place 


Availability - Daniel Kahneman defines availability heuristic as the process of judging frequencies by the ease with which it comes to our mind. We focus on existing evidence and ignore the ones that are absent. He defines this by the term WYSIATI – What You See Is All There Is.

Commitment and consistency - Once we have made a commitment which could be in the form of promise, effort, money, belief, relationships etc, we remain consistent.  We associate high degree of consistency with personal and intellectual strengths. Foot in the door technique: get people to agree with something small first – to be consistent they will then agree on something bigger. It's also hard for people to change their opinion once they believed something for a long time. 

Deprival Super Reaction Syndrome - When something we like is taken away or threatened to be taken away, we get upset. Taking away people’s freedom, status, money or anything they value will result in Deprival Super Reaction Syndrome(DSRS). Includes desiring and valuing more what we can't have or what is (or threatens to be) less available. We dislike losing the things we have more than we appreciate gaining the things we don’t have. We also want what we can’t have and the less available something is, the more we want it. When we almost have something but it is taken away last minute, we react as if it was ours all along 

Do Something Bias – we as humans are often incentivized to do something, even at times it would be better to not do something given our lack of knowledge or understanding in a particular topic. There is no reason to do a good job with something you shouldn't do in the first place. "We've got great flexibility and a certain discipline in terms of not doing some foolish thing just to be active - discipline in avoiding just doing any damn thing just because you can't stand inactivity." There's no use running if you're on the wrong road."

Envy and jealousy - We are genetically wired to compare, even though we clearly shouldn’t

Self deception and denial - We must at no point fool ourselves and not get into a state a denial where we are blaming others and not taking full responsibility ourselves. 

Status quo bias / do nothing syndrome - We prefer to keep things the way they are

Pavlovian Association: Ivan Pavlov very effectively demonstrated that animals can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects; remember the famous dogs salivating at the ring of a bell. Human beings are much the same and can feel positive and negative emotion towards intangible objects, with the emotion coming from past associations rather than direct effects.

Fundamental Attribution Error: We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future. In such a situation, predicting behavior seems not very difficult. Of course, in practice this assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong, and we are consequently surprised when others do not act in accordance with the “innate” traits we’ve endowed them with.

Influence of Stress (Including Breaking Points): Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman’s “System 2” type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto: “In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”

Appeal to authority - You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true.

Pluralistic Ignorance:  Phenomenon where a group goes along with a norm, even though all of the group members secretly hate it, because each mistakenly believes that the others approve of it.

Subselves: We use different mental processes in different situations, so each of us is not a single character but a collection of different characters, who take turns to commandeer the body depending on the situation. There is an office “you”, a lover “you”, an online “you”, etc.

Excessive self regard: when we overestimate our own capabilities, especially when we have little experience. The more incompetent someone, the less they realize they’re incompetent. We tend to overvalue ourselves. The best antidote to this is to force yourself to think more objectively about yourself and just realize that we are all fragile and the value from life is in bringing happiness to ourselves and those around us 


Hedonic treadmill: we pursue things because we think they will make us happy. When we reach that, we feel pleasure and success for a very short time and then our success no longer gives us pleasure. As a result, we seek something new and the cycle repeats. 

Attribution error: when others screw up we blame character. When we screw up we blame circumstance. 

## Negotiation
The Third Story — The Third Story is one an impartial observer, such as a mediator, would tell; it’s a version of events both sides can agree on.

Trade-offs — A situation that involves losing one quality or aspect of something in return for gaining another quality or aspect.

Incentives — Something that motivates an individual to perform an action. We do what is rewarding and avoid what we are punished for.

Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) — The most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached.

win-win — A win–win strategy is a conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all disputants.

Zero-sum vs Non-zero-sum — A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant’s gain (or loss) of utility is exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other participant(s)…In contrast, non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties’ aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero.


## Psychology
Appeal to Emotion — Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.

Cognitive dissonance: in the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values


## Decision making
Occam’s Razor: Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.. When selecting among competing explanations, prefer the simplest explanation with the least moving parts. It is also often the solution with the fewest assumptions. Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

Scenario Analysis — A process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes.

Sensitivity Analysis — The study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs.

Cost-benefit Analysis — A systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities or functional requirements for a business.

Net Present Value — a measurement of the profitability of an undertaking that is calculated by subtracting the present values of cash outflows (including initial cost) from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time.

Crowdsourcing — The process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, especially an online community, rather than from employees or suppliers.

wisdom of the crowd — a large group’s aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group.

Business Case — Captures the reasoning for initiating a project or task. It is often presented in a well-structured written document, but may also sometimes come in the form of a short verbal argument or presentation.

Opportunity Cost — The value of the best alternative forgone where, given limited resources, a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the ‘cost’ incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice.

Local vs Global Optimum — A local optimum of an optimization problem is a solution that is optimal (either maximal or minimal) within a neighboring set of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a global optimum, which is the optimal solution among all possible solutions, not just those in a particular neighborhood of values.

Decision Trees — A decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

Sunk Cost — A cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. 

Preserving Optionality — A strategy of keeping options open and fluid, fighting the urge to make choices too soon, before all of the uncertainties have been resolved.

Information Asymmetry — The study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other.

Adverse selection — when traders with better private information about the quality of a product will selectively participate in trades which benefit them the most.

Moral hazard — when one person takes more risks because someone else bears the cost of those risks.

Eisenhower decision matrix — what is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.

Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions — For reversible decisions: “If the decision was a bad call you can unwind it in a reasonable period of time. An irreversible decision is firing an employee, launching your product, a five-year lease for an expensive new building, etc. These are usually difficult or impossible to reverse.”


## Biases
black swan theory — a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. Things seem unlikely. But the occurrence of one black swan proves that they exists. Nobody can say they are no black swans, because nobody saw all black swans in their life

Selection Bias — The selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. 

Survivorship Bias — The logical error of concentrating on the people or things that ‘survived’ some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility.

Response Bias — A wide range of cognitive biases that influence the responses of participants away from an accurate or truthful response.

Observer Effect — Changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed.

Sampling Bias - a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others.

Availability Bias — People tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

Confirmation Bias — The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities.

Base rate bias - An unconscious failure to look at past odds in determining current or future behavior.. If presented with related base rate information (i.e. generic, general information) and specific information (information pertaining only to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter. we sometimes failure to look past odds when detmining future behaviour. E,g. we notice that sometime who smoked all his life can turn 95. Sure, but what are the odds when you compare a group of 1000 smokers vs 1000 non smokers? 

Tendency to Stereotype - The tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. 

Gambler's Fallacy - the erroneous belief that if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa), when it has otherwise been established that the probability of such events does not depend on what has happened in the past. 

Anecdotal — Using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence.

Hindsight Bias — The inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it.

Anchoring A cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the “anchor”) when making decisions. 

Incentive bias - People do what they perceive is in their best interest and are biased by incentives: don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut  

First conclusion bias: the idea that the first idea gets in a mind and then the mind shuts. This is dangerous – it can lead us to accept erroneous results and cease asking questions

The overconfidence effect is a well-established bias in which a person's subjective confidence in his or her judgements is reliably greater than the objective accuracy of those judgements, especially when confidence is relatively high

Tendency to Overgeneralize from Small Samples: We take a small number of instances and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.

Belief bias - If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you'll rationalize anything that supports it.

Self-serving bias - You believe your failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes. Also being overly positive view of our abilities and future. 

Negativity bias - You allow negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.

Optimism bias - You overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes. “Man suffers much because he seeks too much, is foolishly ambitious and grotesquely overestimates his capacities” We see ourselves as unique and special. We overestimate the degree of control we have over events and underestimate chance. 

Pessimism bias - You overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes.

In-group bias - You unfairly favor those who belong to your group.

Sbsence bias - we can't identify what we can't observe.

Model bias: the assumption that our idea or model is the best. Instead, we must remember there is more than one way to get something done and good ideas can come from everywhere 


## Thinking
Arguing from First Principles — A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. 

Thought Experiment — considers some hypothesis, theory, or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences.

Systems Thinking — By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences.

Lateral Thinking — Solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic.

Man with the hammer syndrome — if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Divergent Thinking vs Convergent Thinking — Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. It is often used in conjunction with its cognitive opposite, convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ‘correct’ solution.

First order vs second order effects — first order effects directly follow from a cause, while second order effects follow from first order effects.

thinking fast vs thinking slow — a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ‘System 1’ is fast, instinctive and emotional; ‘Systecm 2’ is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.

Second order thinking: in most complex systems, the second layer of effects are bigger than the first one. Make sure you consider non primary effects before committing to something. 

Probabilistic Thinking: trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass. 


## Problem solving
Proximate vs Root Cause — A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the ‘real’ reason something occurred.

Five Whys: just keep asking why all the time, with the ultimate goal of getting to the root cause of a specific problem 

Scientific Method — Systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.

Proxy — A variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable. In order for a variable to be a good proxy, it must have a close correlation, not necessarily linear, with the variable of interest.

Divide and Conquer — Recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

Inversion: thinking backwards – it’s a problem solving technique. Often by considering what we want to avoid rather than what we want to get, we come up with better solutions. Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance. In business: list how projects can fail, assign a probability to each failure and prioritize actions to avoid these faillures. Essentially, do the opposite of all the things that could go wrong 


## Statistics
Normal Distribution — A very common continuous probability distribution…Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have distributions that are nearly normal.

Overfitting: the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably

False Positives and False Negatives — A false positive error, or in short false positive, commonly called a ‘false alarm’, is a result that indicates a given condition has been fulfilled, when it actually has not been fulfilled…A false negative error, or in short false negative, is where a test result indicates that a condition failed, while it actually was successful, i.e. erroneously no effect has been assumed.

Confidence Interval — Confidence intervals consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter; however, the interval computed from a particular sample does not necessarily include the true value of the parameter.

Bayes theorem - In probability theory and statistics, Bayes’ theorem (alternatively Bayes’ law or Bayes' rule, also written as Bayes’s theorem) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, a person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.

Regression to the Mean — The phenomenon that if a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on its second measurement.

Law of large numbers - One of the fundamental underlying assumptions of probability is that as more instances of an event occur, the actual results will converge on the expected ones. For example, if I know that the average man is 5 feet 10 inches tall, I am far more likely to get an average of 5′10″ by selecting 500 men at random than 5 men at random. The opposite of this model is the law of small numbers, which states that small samples can and should be looked at with great skepticism.

Central Limit Theorem – a large, properly drawn sample will resemble the population from which it is drawn 

Expected value: In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.


## Physics
Critical Mass — The smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. In social dynamics, critical mass is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth.

Activation Energy — The minimum energy which must be available to a chemical system with potential reactants to result in a chemical reaction.

Catalyst — A substance which increases the rate of a chemical reaction.

Inertia — the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion; this includes changes to its speed, direction or state of rest. It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity.

Friction and Viscosity: Both friction and viscosity describe the difficulty of movement. Friction is a force that opposes the movement of objects that are in contact with each other, and viscosity measures how hard it is for one fluid to slide over another.

Homeostasis and Equilibrium: Homeostasis is the process through which systems self-regulate to maintain an equilibrium state that enables them to function in a changing environment.


## Manipulation
Ad Hominem — Attacking your opponent’s character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.

Straw Man — Giving the impression of refuting an opponent’s argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent.

Bribery: Given the chance, it is often easier to pay a certain agent to look the other way than to follow the rules. The enforcer of the rules is then neutralized. This principle/agent problem can be seen as a form of arbitrage.

The texas sharpshooter - You cherry-picked a data cluster to suit your argument, or found a pattern to fit a presumption.

Tu quoque - You avoided having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser - you answered criticism with criticism.

Ambiguity - You used a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.

Strawman - You misrepresented someone's argument to make it easier to attack.


## Managing
Forcing Function — A forcing function is any task, activity or event that forces you to take action and produce a result.

Directly Responsible Individual — A management concept, originally championed by Apple, that good things come if someone is explicitly responsible for something. 

Pygmalion Effect — The phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance.

Zero Tolerance — Strict punishment for infractions of a stated rule, with the intention of eliminating undesirable conduct.

## Systems
Theory of constraints —a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.

Bottleneck – the place at which a flow is stopped and holding everything back from further movement

A cascading failure is a process in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts can trigger the failure of other parts and so on.

Garbage in, garbage out. Give a system bad input and will return bad output 

Refactoring is the process of changing a system to improve efficiency without changing the output of the system. Refactoring starts by Deconstructing a process or system, then looking for Patterns. What are the critical processes that absolutely must be done right in order to achieve the desired objective? Do those processes have to be completed in a certain order? What are the current Constraints? What appears to be particularly important? Collect as much information about how the system works as you can, then sit with it for a while.

The paradox of automation: the more automated a system, the more important it is for humans to have an eye out and intervene when necessary

The irony of automation: the more automated a system, the less people have to do and the less attention the will have 

## Business
Minimum Viable Product — A product with just enough features to gather validated learning about the product and its continued development.

Product/Market Fit — the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand.

pivot — structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.

Technology Adoption Lifecycle — Describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or “bell curve”. The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called ‘innovators’, followed by ‘early adopters’. Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called ‘laggards’.

Barriers to Entry — A cost that must be incurred by a new entrant into a market that incumbents don’t or haven’t had to incur.

arbitrage — the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets.

Winner Take All Market — A market that tends towards one dominant player. 

First-mover advantage vs First-mover disadvantage — the advantage gained by the initial (“first-moving”) significant occupant of a market segment.

Sustainable Competitive Advantage — Structural factors that allow a firm to outcompete its rivals for many years.

Switching Costs — The costs associated with switching suppliers.

Network Effect — The effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it.

Economies of Scale — The cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to size, output, or scale of operation, with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units of output.

Exit Strategy — A means of leaving one’s current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure.

Churn: Churn is present in many business and human systems: A constant figure is periodically lost and must be replaced before any new figures are added over the top.

Peter Principle: People in a hierarchy such as a business or government will be promoted until they suck at their jobs, at which point they will remain where they are. As a result, the world is filled with people who suck at their jobs.

Goodhart’s Law: When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to become a measure. E.g. British colonialists tried to control snakes in India. They measured progress by number of snakes killed, offering money for snake corpses. People responded by breeding snakes & killing them.


## Economics
Supply and Demand — An economic model of price determination in a market. It concludes that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.

Principle agent problem: if you want something done, do it yourself. If not, send an agent as they won’t care as much

Price Elasticity — The measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another. It gives answers to questions such as ‘If I lower the price of a product, how much more will sell?’

Market Power — The ability of a firm to profitably raise the market price of a good or service over marginal cost.

Veblen goods — types of luxury goods, such as expensive wines, jewelry, fashion-designer handbags, and luxury cars, which are in demand because of the high prices asked for them.

Comparative Advantage — An agent has a comparative advantage over another in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.

Creative Destruction — Process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. Coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, the term “creative destruction” describes the capitalistic process at work in a functioning free-market system. Motivated by personal incentives (including but not limited to financial profit), entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology. Beware getting left behind.

A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity. 

Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa

Externalities — An externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.

Deadweight Loss — A loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved or is not achievable.

Marginal costs – the costs of the next item produced

Inflation — A sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — A monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly).

Specialization (Pin Factory). Adam Smith, highlighted the advantages gained in a free-market system by specialization. Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that it’s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. He also cautioned, however, that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.


## Strategy
Core Competency — A harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace.

Strategy vs Tactics — Sun Tzu: Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.

Fighting the Last War — Using strategies and tactics that worked successfully in the past, but are no longer as useful.

Winning a Battle but Losing the War — A poor strategy that wins a lesser (or sub-) objective but overlooks and loses the true intended objective.

Zugzwang is a situation found in chess and other turn-based games wherein one player is put at a disadvantage because of their obligation to make a move; in other words, the fact that the player is compelled to move means that their position will become significantly weaker. A player is said to be "in zugzwang" when any possible move will worsen their position.

Seizing the Middle: In chess, the winning strategy is usually to seize control of the middle of the board, so as to maximize the potential moves that can be made and control the movement of the maximal number of pieces. 


## Military
Guerilla warfare — a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants such as paramilitary personnel, armed civilians, or irregulars use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military.

Flypaper Theory — The idea that it is desirable to draw enemies to a single area, where it is easier to kill them and they are far from one’s own vulnerabilities.

Trojan Horse — After a fruitless 10-year siege, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden horse, and hid a select force of men inside. The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. That night the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under cover of night. The Greeks entered and destroyed.

Empty Fort Strategy — Involves using reverse psychology (and luck) to deceive the enemy into thinking that an empty location is full of traps and ambushes, and therefore induce the enemy to retreat.

Potemkin village — any construction (literal or figurative) built solely to deceive others into thinking that a situation is better than it really is.

Containment — A military strategy to stop the expansion of an enemy. 

Appeasement — A diplomatic policy of making political or material concessions to an enemy power in order to avoid conflict.

Attrition warfare — a military strategy in which a belligerent attempts to win a war by wearing down the enemy to the point of collapse through continuous losses in personnel and material.

Seeing the Front: One of the most valuable military tactics is the habit of “personally seeing the front” before making decisions – not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be either faulty or biased. The Map/Territory model illustrates the problem with not seeing the front, as does the incentive model. Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as not only does it provide firsthand information, but it also tends to improve the quality of secondhand information.

Asymmetric Warfare: The asymmetry model leads to an application in warfare whereby one side seemingly “plays by different rules” than the other side due to circumstance. 

Two-Front War: The Second World War was a good example of a two-front war. Once Russia and Germany became enemies, Germany was forced to split its troops and send them to separate fronts, weakening their impact on either front. In practical life, opening a two-front war can often be a useful tactic, as can solving a two-front war or avoiding one, as in the example of an organization tamping down internal discord to focus on its competitors.


## Influence
Framing — With the same information being used as a base, the ‘frame’ surrounding the issue can change the reader’s perception without having to alter the actual facts.

Cialdini’s Six Principles of Influence 
    - Reciprocity (People tend to return a favor - both good and bad)
    - Commitment (If people commit…they are more likely to honor that commitment.)
    - Social Proof (People will do things they see other people are doing.)
    - Authority (People will tend to obey authority figures.)
    - Liking (People are easily persuaded by other people they like.)
    - Scarcity (Perceived scarcity will generate demand). 

Paradox of Choice — Eliminating consumer choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers.

Hick’s Law = increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically

Winning Hearts and Minds — In which one side seeks to prevail not by the use of superior force, but by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side.


## Politics
Chilling Effect — The inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction

Third Rail — The third rail of a nation’s politics is a metaphor for any issue so controversial that it is ‘charged’ and ‘untouchable’ to the extent that any politician or public official who dares to broach the subject will invariably suffer politically.

Regulatory Capture — When a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.

Shirky principle — Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.


## Investing
Margin of Safety — The difference between the intrinsic value of a stock and its market price. It does also generally refer to having a margin in nearly everything we do to avoid unnecessary risks. 

Compound Interest — Interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously-accumulated interest. It is an exponential effect, rather than a linear, or additive, effect. Einstein called compounding a wonder of the world. Money compounds, but so does ideas and relationships. 

Efficient-Market Hypothesis — Asset prices fully reflect all available information

Insider Trading — The trading of a public company’s stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company.

Return on Investment: A finance concept: for every dollar you invest, how much are you getting back?

Time Horizon: the right investment decision changes based on the time period you are optimizing for.


## Learning
Deliberate Practice — How expert one becomes at a skill has more to do with how one practices than with merely performing a skill a large number of times.

Imposter Syndrome — High-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud’.

Dunning-Kruger Effect — Relatively unskilled persons suffer illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is…[and] highly skilled individuals may underestimate their relative competence and may erroneously assume that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others.

Spacing Effect — The phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of time in a single session.


## Philosophy
Consequentialism — Holding that the consequences of one’s conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.

Effective Altruism — Encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based on their values.

Utilitarianism — Holding that the best moral action is the one that maximizes utility.

Agnosticism — The view that the truth values of certain claims — especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether God, the divine, or the supernatural exist — are unknown and perhaps unknowable.


## General
Power-law — A functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.

Pareto principle — for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

Diminishing returns: results are subject to an eventual decrease of incremental value

Local Maxima: the point where incremental improvements creates no customer value at all, forcing you to make a step change in product capabilities.

Premature optimization - a phrase used to describe a situation where a programmer lets performance considerations affect the design of a piece of code. This can result in a design that is not as clean as it could have been or code that is incorrect, because the code is complicated by the optimization and the programmer is distracted by optimizing.

Leverage — The force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device or machine system. It should be considered a framework outside of engineering.

Paradigm shift — a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline.

Tipping point - thresholds that, when exceeded, can lead to large changes in the state of the system

Reproducability: doing a same experiment twice will lead to the same results 

Order of Magnitude — An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten.

Intuition — Personal experience coded into your personal neural network, which means your intuition is dangerous outside the bounds of your personal experience.

False Cause — Presuming that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.

Plausible — Thinking that just because something is plausible means that it is true.

Likely — Thinking that just because something is possible means that it is likely.

Slippery Slope — Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually happen too, therefore A should not happen.

Black or White — When two alternative states are presented as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.

Unintended Consequences — Outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action.

Collateral damage — Deaths, injuries, or other damage inflicted on an unintended target.

Streisand Effect — The phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely

Cobra effect — when an attempted solution to a problem actually makes the problem worse.

Short-termism — Short-termism refers to an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.

Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset — Those with a ‘fixed mindset’ believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.

Technical Debt — A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.

Correlation does not imply causation - Correlation is a statistical measure (expressed as a number) that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable. Causation indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e. there is a causal relationship between the two events. This is also referred to as cause and effect.

Design Pattern — The re-usable form of a solution to a design problem.

Anti-pattern — a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.

Moore’s Law — The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

circle of competence — you don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital. Stick to what you know. 

Unknown Unknowns — Known unknowns refers to ‘risks you are aware of, such as cancelled flights….’ Unknown unknowns are risks that ‘come from situations that are so out of this world that they never occur to you.

NIMBY — Not In My Back Yard

Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) — A pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.

Murphy’s Law — Anything that can go wrong, will.

Hofstadter’s Law, It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.

Planning fallacy: people underestimate how long projects take. Large projects have many interdependencies which increases the risk of things not going according to plan

Parkinson’s Law — Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

Gate’s Law — Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.

Chain Reaction — A sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, positive feedback leads to a self-amplifying chain of events.

A domino effect is the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of similar events

Natural Selection — The differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in heritable traits of a population over time.

Butterfly Effect — The concept that small causes can have large effects.

Sustainability — The endurance of systems and processes.

Contrast mis-reaction tendency - judging and perceiving the absolute
magnitude of something not by itself but based only on its difference to something else presented closely in time or space or to some earlier adaptation level. Also underestimating the consequences over time of gradual changes.
How we value things depends on what we compare them with (e.g. going from hot to cold water). We value things by comparing them to something else rather than analysing each piece standalone. Leather seats of 3,000 are not cheap, but we tell ourselves such things as we compare it to a 50,000 car


Lollapalooza effect - When two or more psychological biases combine together, the effect get compounded on a tremendous scale. 

Randomness: much of the wold is composed of random, non-sequential events. We are ‘fooled’ when we attribute causality to things that are actually outside of our control. When bad things happen, we try to find causal explanations or something to blame. The more unexpected or negative we find an event, the more likely we are to look for explanations. We underestimate the influence of randomness. Here we define a random event as an event that can't be predicted because of a lack of knowledge. An event is random when we don't have enough information to determine its outcome in advance.

Specialization – if people are specialized in performing singular tasks, this often increases productivity

Reframing: take a possible worldview, discard it and select another one. Take a look at an external event. Try to negative views into more positive ones. See ‘bad’ events as a challenge for you to go out there and improve yourself. 

The Map is not the Territory : Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. This is important to keep in mind as we think through problems and make better decisions.

Feedback Loops: All complex systems are subject to positive and negative feedback loops whereby A causes B, which in turn influences A (and C), and so on

Multiplying by Zero: Any reasonably educated person knows that any number multiplied by zero, no matter how large the number, is still zero. 

Single Point of Failure: A part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working.

Flywheel (recursive feedback loop):A state where a positive or negative feedback loop is feeding on itself and accelerating from it’s own momentum.

The curse of knowledge - Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone.

Fundamental attribution error - You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation.

The halo effect - How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgments of them.

The framing effect - You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery.

The placebo effect - If you believe you're taking medicine it can sometimes 'work' even if it's fake.

Reactance - You'd rather do the opposite of what someone is trying to make you do

The spotlight effect - You overestimate how much people notice how you look and act.

Causal Reductionism: Things rarely happen for just 1 reason. Usually, outcomes result from many causes conspiring together. But our minds cannot process such a complex arrangement, so we tend to ascribe outcomes to single causes, reducing the web of causality to a mere thread.

Focusing Illusion: Nothing is ever as important as what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about it. E.g. worrying about a thing makes the thing being worried about seem worse than it is. As Marcus Aurelius observed, “We suffer more often in imagination that in reality.”

Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest to look. E.g. the majority of research uses only the sources that appear on the first page of Google search results, regardless of how factual they are. 

Matthew Principle: Advantage begets advantage, leading to social, economic, and cultural oligopolies. The richer you are the easier it is to get even richer, the more recognition a scientist receives for a discovery the more recognition he’ll receive for future discoveries, etc.

Shifting Baseline Syndrome: Frog says to Fish, “how’s the water?”Fish replies, “what’s water?” We become blind to what we’re familiar with. And since the world is always changing, and we're always getting used to it, we can even become blind to the slow march of catastrophe.

Persian Messenger Syndrome - not wanting to be the carrier of bad news

Impatience - valuing the present more highly than the future.

Vividness and recency - Over-influence by vivid or the most recent information. “A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic”. After a bad event happens, we overestimate the probability of it happening again. E.g. after a earthquake, insurance sales rise sharply. 

Omission and abstract blindness - only seeing stimuli we encounter or that grabs our attention, and neglecting important missing information or the abstract. We react more strongly to the concrete and specific than to the abstract. We overweigh personal experiences over vicarious. We see only what we have names for. We tend to focus only on the present information rather than what information may potentially be missing. For example, when planning, we often place too much importance on the specific future event and not enough on other possible events and their consequences that can 
cause the event to be delayed or not happen.

Bias from disliking - our tendency to avoid and disagree with people we don't like or to avoid things that cause bad reactions

Sensemaking - Constructing explanations that fit an outcome. Includes beingng too quick in drawing conclusions. Also thinking events that have happened were more predictable than they were. We don't like uncertainty. We have a need to understand and make sense of events. We therefore seek explanations for why things happen. We want to find reasons for all kinds of events – random or not 

Reason-respecting - complying with requests merely because we've been given a reason. Includes underestimating the power in giving people reasons. Giving people a reason to do something makes them more likely to comply with the request. Depending on the situation and people involved, either revert to logic or emotions. 

Believing first and doubting later - believing what is not true, especially when distracted. -	We are not natural sceptics. We find it easy to believe and difficult to doubt because that takes more effort

Memory limitations - remembering selectively and wrong. Includes influence by suggestions.

Say-something syndrome - feeling a need to say something when we have nothing to say. “Wise man talk because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something”

Emotional arousal – making hasty judgments under the influence of intense emotions. We expect that if good or bad things happen to us in the future, they will make us feel better or worse much longer and more intensively than they actually turn out to be. When we have just gone through an emotional experience, we should hold off on important decisions.

Doubt-Avoidance Tendency - We avoid doubt quickly by making rash decisions rather than taking our time to think things through 

Pain-Avoiding psychological Denial: When the reality is too painful to bear, we distort the facts until they become bearable 

Availability-Mis Weighing Tendency: We value and want to deal with things easily available 

Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency. If we acquire a skill, we’ll use it unless often used. We need to keep practicing as a way to better ourselves and not to become the man with the hammer
