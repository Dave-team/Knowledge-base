## Journal
- Txt file that is backed up to Github 
- Each month I might summarise the main findings in a Markup file and push to the knowledge base

Questions to answer in a journal: 
- How do I feel today? This can be split between happiness levels, stress and energy. Rate between 1-10 and provide notes. Go deep and ask why 
- What am I grateful for? (a good proxy is to aim for 3 things each though to force the thinking)
- What interesting things happened yesterday? Can be amazing things, learnings, negative things 
- What's on top of mind today? 
- What will make today great? Why is today an opportunity instead of another day to get through?
- What good shall I do this day?
- Is there anything that you need to get off your chest? 
- How is your overall happiness trending? What are my thoughts lately? 
- Anything else? 

Also, it is wort repeating the most important focus points at that time in my life in the journal which forces me to see the priorities each day 
Marcus Aurelius worked hard to be a good friend to himself. Although he was firm and strong and self-disciplined, he did not whip himself. He knew that it was inevitable that he would mess up. We all do. What would a good friend say to you today? Type that now.
