# Data visualization 
## Principles
- Don’t make people think 
- Make use of conventions: 
    - People read in Z shapes: left corner is the most important 
    - Group related content together 
- Eliminate all questions that could be in the heads of your users 
- Use contrast to direct focus. Can be using color, contrast, position 
- Eliminate clutter: remove anything that doesn’t serve a purpose 
- Minimize any noise 
- Avoid complexity
- Create a story from high level and then more context
- Use consistency. E.g. if a target line is blue in one graph, it should be blue everywhere
- Dashboards need to be actionable. Focus on insights and impact. People need to immediately spot: 'What does this tell me?'. Some tactics: 
    - Compare against target lines 
    - Compare against budgets 
    - Use red and green to indicate good and bad
- When information would add context, don't be afraid of adding this text

### Good graphs
- Title is descriptive title
- Axis titles are descriptive and e.g. include currency 
- Axis values are clear and readable 
- Data values are in the right format
- Data is sorted: e.g. sort bar charts from high to low. Order data tables logically and include the ordering in the title 
- Annotate anything that would raise questions in the graph
- Remove anything that could raise questions - e.g. don't show NULL values 
- Column charts should be sorted such that the largest values are at the bottom
- Hide a legend when the legend is too big - people will just hover over 
- Add a total on top of column charts 


### Good dashboards
- Good dashboards are interactiove: 
    - Filters to segment data
    - Ability to drill down to look into the details
    - Helpful tooltips to understand the data better when hovering over a graph  
- Designed with the use case in mind (test this!): 
    - Check the sizing of the dashboard on multiple devices
    - In a dashboard will be used in meetings, spotting good / bad should be possible from afar
- Good looking
- Include the company’s color palette 
- Use of clear headers
- Single value visualizations go at the top of the dashboard
- Make use of placeholders when there is some WIP
- Where relevant, notes can be added in text boxes
- Headers and graphs are well sized
- Consider adding a tile that outlines what the user is looking at 
- Only show the critical few metrics to portray the story. 6 metrics by dashboard is a good starting point  
- Data is logically laid out and well alligned 
- Leverage white space
- Similar timeframe across all visualizations
