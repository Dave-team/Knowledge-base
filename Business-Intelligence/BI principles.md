# BI principles
## Impact 
Understand the business and use data to improve the business. Establish yourself as a business partner
Think as a stakeholder - what do they care about? Be curious around their business function (Google, YouTube, Looker Blocks) and figure out how to make their lives easier and help them achieve their goals 

- What do we have and what can we do with that?
- What do we want and how can we get that? 

## Relationships
Build strong realtionship with the tech and the business teams. The goal is to establish trust that makes me a business partner they want to work with to achieve their goals
- Informal: chat in the kitchen, go for coffee / lunch
- Formal: work on projects, regular catch-ups, shadow them 

This is where the BI cycle comes in: 
- Manage expectations
- Demonstrate small success
- Communicate the results 


## Evangelize
Sell your work – have a pitch ready at all times. Explain the value of data and what we’re working on. Once we build something useful, share with others who might benefit from this data too 

## User experience
Think about BI as if it's a SaaS product and the users are your customers. 
- Data is available, correct, helpful, relevant and current 
- Data tools are easy to use 
- Great support, documentation, onboarding / training
- Great support to help improve business

## Automate
- Scale things when relevant and possible. The purpose is as much self service as possible so that BI team can focus on more interesting and complex analytical questions. However, the challenges of self service is that people need to know the data well when they create reports out of it
