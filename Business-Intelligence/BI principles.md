## Mindset
Think about BI as if it's a SaaS product and the users are your customers. Approach it as running the growth team where you improve your offering step by step by running experiments and analysing the results and always solving solutions for your end users first. 

## Principles
### Data principles
- Data is correct and quality controlled. Shipping out bad data quickly destroys the team's credibility. The business needs to trust the data 
- Data is available to answer relevant questions 
- Data is current 
- Data is consistent when looking at it in different ways 
- Data tools are fast and easy to use 
- Data is democratized and the BI tool is self service
- Data is well documented 
- Automate as much as possible 
- As much as possible is defined in code
- DAta is version controlled

### Process principles
- Great support, documentation, onboarding / training
- Great business partnering to help improve business
- Code is version controlled and development is approved through pull requests with code review
- Code is modular - there should be one version that is used throughout an entire project - data needs to be conformed
- We work incrementally: 
    - Deliver continiously 
    - Demonstrate early success 
    - Communicate results 
    - Get feedback 
    - Improve

## Values
- Humility. Be humble and nice. Realize we are not the domain expert - the stakeholder is. When we make mistakes, be honest and build a deep of trust. 
- Helpfulness. Business Intelligence is a support function to help the business make decisions from data. Don't be afraid to do some chores to help others as it will greatly improve relationships and you will get more context. Also be very mindful of the burden on other teams. If you come with a request or an ask from another team, it’s important that you let them know you’re interested in partnering with them to make the process as easy on them as possible to minimize disruption to their workflow.

## BI definition
Business Intelligence is about making sure that people get the insights from the data they need to perform their job, in an easy way. 

Business Intelligence: delivering the right support to the right people at the right time. It’s about having the ability to execute, monitor and control business processes, along with insights about how to improve them. 

Data is needed to:
- Make decisions – you don’t want to rely on your gut. Do we invest in more people? Do we cut this product? Do we invest in a marketing strategy similar to the previous one? Should this sales person be let go? 
- Solve problems – diving in the idea can help getting to the root cause of a problem you’re seeing
- Track performance – without data, you don’t know where you are going 
- Improve business – by deeper analysing the performance (e.g. by segment, by time) you can uncover trends that lead to ideas to improve the business. E.g. improve customer experience, reduce costs, improve conversion rates.
- Understanding the customer / market: we can track how customers behave, you can identify your personas


**BI benefits**
- Central space for multiple data sources that can be combined. No more information islands and a more holistic view over entire business (e.g. marketing funnel) and customer journey. What happens to the customer we spent so much on to acquire? How do we attribute it? 
- Scalable. Everything is written in code with documentation that is easy to debug. Spreadsheets are hard to maintain and bedug as well as to understand for others 
- Time saver. Saving lots of time doing analysis when people can use a tool like Looker - time can now be spend doing higher impact activities
- Improve data quality and quality control as the data sits in a central environment managed by analyst and best practices in data testing are employed
- Single source of truth documented centrally. Instead of different spreadsheets created by different people with different definitions/logic. This documented environment allows scaling and increases transparency across the business 
- Easy access to insights 
- Allow more complex analysis using data transformations
- Increased data security – no more spreadsheets flying around over email and in the cloud 

**Why do we need data?**
- To make decisions based on facts rather than our gut 
- To track performance
- Ultimate to help improve business performance 

## Impact 
The real value of data comes into play when it actually helps the business. The goal is to answer" 'So what?' and 'Now what?' and the end result should be recommendations or actions to be taken to improve the business. And then we need to follow through to ensure this impact has been delivered. Closing the loop means pushing action items through and following up after implementation to measure real impact. Watch out for taking the data for granted is the biggest bad habit to watch out for when analysts join the team. This leads to incomplete business logic and bad data that leaks into analysis. Shipping out bad data is adding negative value to the company, and very quickly destroys an analyst’s credibility.

To get the maximum impact from data on the business, I first need to understand the business well: 
- Understand each team's main priorities and their KPIs  
- Think as a stakeholder - what are their main business goals? Be curious around their business function (Google, YouTube, Looker Blocks) and figure out how to make their lives easier and help them achieve their goals 
- Regularly meet the different stakeholders to understand what is in their pipeline and how data can help

Once I have the context, I can establish myself as a business partner - the goal is always to support them reaching their goals. This can come in the form of: 
- Automations: when building solutions, make sure that it integrates seamlessly in the stakeholder's life to ensure maximum impact - a dashboard doesn't impact the business, the actions from the dashboard do. Use actions, integrations, and other automations to make decision making automated. 
- Data and analytics improvement. 
    - Knowing the context and knowing the data well, I can suggest ways to further improve the reporting in place. A huge sign of effectiveness as you progress in your role is the ability to identify and answer the questions that influence decisions – this is not always what someone asks for
    - I can also start to provide insights to various reports we send out. Add comments to analysis, proactively answer questions and become a trusted business partner. As long as data team is being updated on this, we can follow the crumbs, go deeper in the analysis and provide insights 
    - I can start to find new use cases for high impact data analytics project based on knowing the goals of the stakeholders. For example, are we doing manual forecasting? The data team could support. Or I can explore some data that leads to new insights and present this to the business 

*Case in point*
- Reactive: Stakeholder: ‘Please give me data on X’. Me: Okay – here it is. End of discussion. This is extremely entry level 
- Good analyst: Stakeholder: ‘Please give me data on X.’ Me: ‘What do you want to get out of the data? Is it to help guiding a decision? Why are you looking at this specifically? Them: For reason X,Y,Z. Me: Okay so you want to know whether X? Stakeholder confirms. Me: okay, there are some other things you might want to consider and previously we’ve seen this. Them: okay, can you show? Me: yes. Then get back and agree on some additional analysis required to solve the problem at hand. 



## Relationships
Build strong realtionship with the tech and the business teams. The goal is to establish trust that makes me a business partner they want to work with to achieve their goals. 

**What to discuss**
- What the team is working on - updates on projects
- What is in the roadmap
- Whether data support is needed
- Anything that could influence data: new product / campaign releases, A/B tests, new KPIs 

**Why build relationships:**
- It will go a long way to increase their effectiviness when things need to be done
- People will be more likely to come to you to ask for help and to tell you when something is wrong because people want to work with you and are comfortable to be honest 
- Context and understanding of the goals which make an analyst better equipped to help the team get impact from data 
- The analyst will understand the business complexity and take it into consideration when doing his / her work 
- Can more easily pick up projects where data can be of benefit or can easily identify opportunities for improvement with all context 
- It is a lot easier to get good insights from data. If someone without real understanding produces data, they just provide data, no insight. You need analyst to really know about the team and their goals and processes and complexities. You want to get to ‘aha’ moments

### Expectations management and stakeholder commitment 
- Business teams are responsible over quality of source data. Ideally, this is part of a process that happens regularly on e.g. calendar invites so there are more eyes to ensure it gets done  
- The business should work with data team to evaluate vendors: do they have an api we can use? Are they supported by Fivetran / Stitch? Think about how it fits in the existing architecture
- Source data should contain unique identifiers to join the data accross sources 
- Changes to KPI defintions need to happen centrally 
- Make sure the data team is up to date on any changes or important events in the business. The data team is the owner of the model. If things change, it's crucial to update this. Help the Data team to be a partner in those changes, not an afterthought
- Stakeholders should feel ownership over the data they use. If they see issues, it should be communicated with the data team
- Underpromise and overdeliver. Because of the nature of data it's hard to estimate how long projects will take. Give an estimate that assumes that everything will take longer than plannedand keep the stakeholders in the loop throughout the project
- Make sure to create understanding that data projects take long and that we need to prioritize what to work on 
- People want more than is asked for? Mention that wasn’t scoped - for now we focus on smaller scope
- When we deal with manual data or otherwise source data that needs to change, make it either the responsibility of the team ƒto change things (i.e. changing Xero data fields) or make something part of a process (e.g. onboarding process: add data to sheet with new joiners). Always try to keep things maintained in the source data and avoid using manual interventions whenever possible.  


**Ways to build relationships:**
- Informal: 
    - Lunch, kitchen chat, informal coffees 
    - Ask the about their lives outside work - kids, commute, anything relevant to the person. 

- Formal
    - Attend meetings
    - Pairing sessions to shadow the business user and learn about their thought process, learn the tools and their limitations. This will give the analyst great context and understanding of data complexity 
    - Catch-ups
    - Quarterly session with the business to work on data roadmap

**Evangelize - always evangelize**
Sell your work – have a pitch ready at all times. Explain the value of data and what we’re working on. Once we build something useful, share with others who might benefit from this data too 

From: “I am helping teams reaching their objectives by making using their data”. To: “Most teams are currently struggling with their analytics. The data sits in Google Sheets, doing the analysis is taking a lot of time and most teams are not currently getting the most value from their analysis. What I will help you with is getting a centralized solution in place, that combines the data from the various source systems. All your reports will then sit in a BI tool that gets automatically updated. The benefits include:
- You can analyse more things as we bring various sources together and we can combine data from these sources
- Creating your reports goes from hours to seconds 
- Because it’s centralized, there won’t be any differences between definitions and calculations, meaning that teams won’t be reporting on different numbers for the same things. Practical introductions to new company:


## BI team 
### Organization
Hub and spoke model works well, where some analysts are part of the central data team (hub) while others are embedded (spoke) or distributed (spoke) throughout the organization.
- Central - those in this role report to and have their priorities set by the Data team. They currently support those in the Distributed role, cover ad-hoc requests, and support all functional groups (business units).
- Embedded - those in this role report to the data team but their priorities are set by their functional groups (business units).
- Distributed - those in this role report to and have their priorities set by their functional groups (business units). However, they work closely with those in the Central role to align on data initiatives and for assistance on the technology stack.

### OKR planning
- Coming from the higher level BizOps/Finance KPIs and the needs of the data team
- Best way to get them is brainstorm with the data team

### Workload 
- 60% of time is spent on achieving the OKRs, 40% is spent on ad hoc / exploratory analyses
- Use a ticketing system and insist anything that takes 30+ minutes is in there. This is to track performance of BI team and to see where the time goes 
- Add stakeholder teams and owner and any tags to tickets 

### Sources for work 
- Communication with the business - both formal and informal that can lead to projects or insights. Ask them what they have in the roadmap, whether I can support in that or whether there is something else I can help with during catch-ups. 
- Being up date on business initivates can spark investigations where data can help. Work closely with the business team to understand priorities, changes made and strategy of the business. Know the marketing calendar so data peaks won’t surprise you. Instead, you can be proactive and directly measure the impact a certain campaign had to then report this back to marketing. 
- Explore something that could lead to insights. Look where no one else is looking. People often don't know what's available until you show it to them
- BI platform optimization - testing, automation, documentation, identify best practices and new tools
- Constantly keep your ears open for things that people want built and add these items to the backlog
- Be more aware of changes that are happening. I might get an email from someone – go deeper and understand how my field of work will be affected 
- Make sure to really know what data you have at work:
  - Follow crumbs: when you hear something about data you don’t know, follow up and understand their process to get the data 	
  - Track the trackers: people who own tools, make sure to build a good relationship and keep up to date with the changes they’re making. 
  - Know the code. This allows better conversations with those actually creating the code. Keep an open line of communication and share the code desired most often 


### Communication
- Key is to create a safe place for team members to ask questions and be vulnerable. Set the example by sharing your own struggles. 
- Make sure that everyone gets feedback from others early on and regularly during their projects. Especially when doing new or complex or highly important 
- Analytics weekly
    - Talk about the business: everyone should understand what drives revenue and profit, which parts of the business drive this, what is the focus / priority of top management 
    - Show and tell. Use time during your team meeting to have a team member present something they have learned or done. It's beneficial to plan this meeting around the end of each sprint. This has many benefits: 
        - Team can ask claryfying questions
        - Team can poke holes in methodology
        - Suggest areas for future research
        - Holds people accountable
        - Spreads the knowledge in the team
        - Allows cross team input
        - More opportunity for review and it can catch errors (‘I have done something similar before with different end results’)
    - Discuss blockers
- BI Slack channel
    - Open channel for anything - it is a safe place to ask questions and discuss shortcomings 
- BI Business Slack 
    - Inform about updates to e.g. Looker
    - Inform about outings/issues. E.g. Looker / AWS down, Facebook job delayed
    - General BI questions 
- Quarterly check-ins with power users / data champions in each team
- Form for end users to fill in. This can be simple requests as well as bugs / issues. Include a Slack channels where requests are automatically posted. Then review these requests and ask the necessary questions in a thread. 

### Issue communication 
**Stakeholder identifies issue**
First, understand the problem

- Wrong data doesn’t always mean wrong. It’s often just a mismatch between expectation and reality. ‘Wrong’ means a difference between expected and presented or with both, backed up with evidence. 
- Begin with questions. 
    - What results would I / you expect to see?
    - Where would I / you check this number to know it is correct? (i.e., source of truth)
- This often leads to three different buckets: 
    - The data is confusing (but not wrong). E.g. the definition of what is measured isn’t very clear. 
    - There might also be a delay in the data - it’s perhaps not completely recent. Make sure to always include the calculation and the data freshness when communicating with end users 
    - The stakeholder is using a faulty source to “check” the data (which is not wrong). E.g. different web tools might calculate things differently. It is not wrong, just different and this can be proofed looking at historical differences in the data 
    - The data really is wrong - this can happen and it’s normal given the complexity involved around data. Our goal is not to prevent all errors from happening, it’s to make sure that errors are small and get caught / resolved quickly 

If there is a problem, we need to go to issue communication

**Issue communication**
The most efficient way to inform your stakeholders is through the platforms / methods they use to consume the data. If your stakeholders consume the data through an automated report emailed to the team every morning, reply all with an explanation of the issue and the estimated time to resolution. If your stakeholders consume the data through your business intelligence tool, display a warning at the top of business intelligence tool (this is a very effective method of communication, but is not available on many systems). If the issue is severe, send out an email, send out a Slack message and even go round to people to tell them about the issue. It is your duty to ensure stakeholders are aware. 

When you catch a problem and correct it, notify the stakeholders in case they also saw something funny and didn’t mention it, and to demonstrate the pro-active monitoring to build trust.

 ## Other
 ### Data readiness
- Strong business sponsorship
- Clear data use cases that warrant a data function. I.e. without data the business will suffer and there are no other ways of answering the questions
- Source data has been looked at as is in a fairly good state 
- Available resources: people are in a state where they know that BI is needed and spend time on it 
- The available data needs to warrant a BI system and the implementation needs to be feasible 

### Indicators that BI is needed 
- Out of the box reporting by tools is no longer sufficient and creates knowledge silos
- Heavy maintenance to sustain in Google Sheets / Excel
- Increase in data volume exceeds limits of current solutions
- Unclear definitions of core KPIs resulting in conflicting analysis and communication
- Growing demand for more advanced analytics
- Frequent data inconsistencies issues and consequent lack of trust in reports
- Increased complexity of calculations / logic due to more advanced business logic
- Requirements to create dashboards visualize performance from multiple sources. Or in general: requirements to combine data from multiple sources 
- Lots of time consumed on data analysis
- Many manual tasks such as manual historicizing of KPIs per week



### Measuring BI success 
- Improved business performance: more revenue / less costs 
- Time savings in doing analytics 
- Whether employees get their questions answered
- Number of users of BI platform
- How often people use the BI tool 
- Centralized definitions and increased consistency 
- Number of uses of the data
