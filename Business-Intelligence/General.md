#General
-	Focus on delivering value – tools and tech are secondary. What are you doing with your data? How are people improving the business performance using your data? The end goal is for data to drive decisions 
-	Don’t aim for perfection – aim for making it good enough (i.e. meeting requirements) and prioritize speed. Realize that it’s hard to make a perfect model that works for all cases. Build it for 80% of the cases first. You can always make it better
-	Focus on small things that we can deliver that add value. Get that live and implemented and tested and used by users. Then continue to build incrementally and continue to have momentum with user adaption.
