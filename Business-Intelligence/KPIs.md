# KPIs
## Principles
- KPIs are needed to provide direction and for management to understand how the business is trending 
- KPIs should tell a story - KPIs help folks transform a qualitative narrative (“We’re bringing joy to under served communities”) into a quantitative measure (“% of engaged users within the past 30 days”).
- KPIs should start high level and then work downwards, like a DAG
- Every KPI should have a clear owner. Work out with this person: 
  - What is the KPI actually measuring?
  - How much influence do you have over the KPI?
  - What will you do when it varies?
  - How frequently should you view it?
- KPIs should be clearly defined. You don’t want any confusion or ambiguity about a core metric that the organization as a whole is trying to drive. You need a clear metric definition, a clear target value, and a clear or standard timeframe (typically, year end). You should know exactly what goes into the calculation of a KPI - nothing shouldn’t be clear 
- KPIs should be measurable. KPIs have to be quantifiable. You must be able to measure progress numerically over time. In other words, there should be a needle that can be moved and not a binary metric. Make sure that KPIs can affect change and we can directly influence the KPIs. 
- KPIs should have targets that are achievable but at a stretch with hard work 
- KPIs should be visible for all to keep track off, see whether the needle is moving in the right direction or whether they need to change things. 
- They need to reflect the business's strategic goals it wants to achieve 

**Good metrics**
- Simple: don’t make metric complex
-	Standardized: have a SSOT that everyone draw from
-	Accurate: be aware of biases that might affect the KPI. This can be in the way the data is collected (e.g. web traffic including internal visits) 
-	Precise: return similar values if repeated with same conditions: aim for larger samples 
-	Robust: they are relatively insensitive to extreme values  
-	Direct: metric should directly measure the underlying process you’re trying to drive 

**Leading and lagging indicators**
- Lagging indicators assess a current state. Also called an output metric. A lagging indicator is easy to measure but hard to change.
- Leading indicators predict a future state. They are also called input metrics. They define what actions are necessary to achieve your goals with measurable outcomes. They “lead” to successfully meeting overall business objectives, which is why they are called “leading”. Examples include renewal rates, upsell rates. Leading indicators are dynamic but difficult to measure. Similarly, overall revenue is often a lagging indicator of past performance but if we segment by region and find sales rapidly growing in a region, that's a leading indicator for more growth. 

**Data driven vs data informed**
- Data informed: use data to help you make a decision. Data-informed means that you use data alongside your unique experience, user research, and other inputs to make decisions. With a data-informed approach, data is just one part of your decision-making process.
- Data driven: data makes the decision. Data-driven doesn’t take your unique experience or insight into account. It’s simply about the cold, hard facts. In this approach, data has the final say.
- Ideally, combine both. For an A/B test, be data driven. For complex projects that e.g. affect customers, be data informed. 

**KPI tips**
- Control for cohorts – this should always be true for time-based KPIs. Remember that cohorts of different ages will mature in different times and make some apples-to-apples comparisons more difficult.
- Develop an action plan ahead of time. Take the hard step and think about what you’ll do when this KPI does change. I always ask my stakeholders: “If this KPI declines by 10%, will you do anything about it? What about 50%? And if so, what exactly and why?”
- Don’t overreact to performance changes. You can: 
  - Smooth it out. Popular methods include 7 day rolling averages or some decay factor – just make sure that the transformed KPI doesn’t lose too much of its original meaning.
  - Be sceptical of % changes – fractions, especially if the numerator and denominator jump around, are extremely hard to pin down. When numbers are small, expect 200% deltas or the like.

**Other**
- There are two type of KPIs:
  - North star metrics. These are strategic metrics that you want to see changing to influence the business
  - Sign post metrics. These are the tactical metrics that need to change for the north star metric to change. If the north star metric is revenue, the sign post metric is number of orders 
- Correlation vs causation: Causation explicitly applies to cases where action A causes outcome B. On the other hand, correlation is simply a relationship. Action A relates to Action B—but one event doesn’t necessarily cause the other event to happen.

## Growth metrics
The single growth metric:
- Retention is built in – this is an indicator that you are delivering and building real value because people keep coming back. Example metrics: Daily/Weekly Active Users. Bad metrics: total registrations/downloads (they don’t show real value) 
- Should be meaningful: i.e. how do you define retention? These should be meaningful  interactions with the product 
- Relevant: should your product be used daily/weekly/monthy?
- Honest: show percentage increase, absolute increase, time period in which this occured 

You can’t let one metric be your all guiding thing as it’s missing the overall picture. Look at retention, engagement and monetization at a bare minimum 
- There are output metrics (these represent results and help set long term goals for the company – e.g. 6m in revenu, 100k WAU). 
- And there are input metrics (represent actions that influence output metric – registrations, upgrades, downloads, etc.). Input metrics are leading, output metrics are lagging. In general, output metrics probably shouldn’t change, whereas input metrics can change depending on the priority of the company 
- Monitor output metrics to see how you’re doing but build experiments around input metrics you can directly influence. Ask yourself: what actions could we take to improve our ‘output metric’? Then you go deep until you get to very actionable projects 

- Never just have a single north star metric. These are lagging and not actionable. Instead, have a few output metrics that account for retention, engagement and monetization. Then break these down into specific input metrics you can run experiments against. Then analyze the results and identify relationship between input and output metrics and adjust accordingly. 

In terms of metrics, be very wary of vanity metrics. Don’t look at comulative numbers, but seek to undersand whether any optimizations delivered better results in metrics across the board (e.g. AARRR framework). Good ways to measure include split tests (i.e. A/B tests) as well as cohort analysis

## AARRR
1. Acquisition: users come to the website from various channels
2. Activation: users enjoy their first visit and become active (note the importance of the AHA moment)
3. Retention: users come back
4. Referral: users like the product enough to refer friends
5. Revenue: users do something that leads you to make money
