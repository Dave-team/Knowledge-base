What does “self-serve” in analytics mean to you?: https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/what-does-self-serve-in-analytics-mean-to-you/712

## Principles
- If you build it, they might come, but they probably won’t unless you’ve stepped into their shoes and answered, “Why should I use this?” and “Okay, so how do I use this?”
- If you teach someone to use a tool and they don’t get it or they later find it frustrating, they’ll look for another way to answer their questions. Before you know it, their alternate path to a solution will become a habit. Good luck getting them back to your tool!
- Be more proactive and figure out how you can support the teams by talking to them
- Take it step by step: sit with one team, work on a problem and solve that problem only. Rinse and repeat with different departments 


## Elements of user adoption

### Data availability
Make sure that Looker has the data available for end users so they can answer their questions. This often means helping the business out by building initial dashboards. It also consists of ensuring the data is complete and current  

### Data reliability
Make sure that end users can trust the data in Looker is reliable. Especially at the start we need to ensure the source data and Looker matches, otherwise people might lose trust

### User Experience
Make sure that end users have a great experience using the data platform. It should:
- Be correct – end users trust that the data is correct 
- Have good documentation so that end users can self-serve their analytics needs. 
- Perform well. Queries should return results fast 
- Be easy to use. 
- Look good. Tools and reports should be clear and attractive. Implement the company's colour pallete 

### Support
Provide great support to end users. 
- Have a dedicated Slack channel used for Looker questions
- Make sure response times are practically instant
- Create custom homepages for end users with links to helpful documents. The homepage can also have the main KPIs compared to target and with last six months trended with really strong drill down functionality 
- Emphasize that people can reach out for more training, check their work or sit together and build something 

### Onboarding
Set up training sessions specific to the requirements of the end user to be trained. Train early and often to make sure Looker is directly ingrained in their habits and workflows. When a tool is hard to use, they'll go back to the tools they know 
- Train end users
    - Kickoff: intro of me, and overview of what we’re going to do and get an understanding of how users want to use the data  
    - Introduction: what is Looker and how is it helpful? 
    - Looker demo: tour of what we have built so far in Looker 
    - Essentials of Looker - dimension, measures, filters, pivots 
    - Practical exercises for users to try: 
        - Explore an existing dashboard 
        - Build a relevant use case from scratch and save it to a dashboard  
    - Explanations of different Looker use cases and how this relates to what the users wanted to get out of the session. Show ‘Looker Blocks’ with dashboards that relate to their function
    - Table calculations, scheduling
    - Building dashboards 
- Provide great documentation (training recordings / slides, FAQs, data dictionary) and make this easily available to end users. For developers, have a best practice LookML document 
- Regularly check in with new users as they go through the change curve to ensure they remain enthusiastic and positive about what Looker can provide them. Track their usage in iLooker.
- Hold regular office hours where people can book a slot to go through something data related
- Always leave them with training docs that explain the Looker basics 

#### Onboarding / training tips
- Really get people involved
    - Allow lots of time for questions 
    - Make the data related to their daily life
    - Ask them to show for something and check what they've done - e.g. a completed dashboard
- Answer their business questions live - focus on their specific use cases
- Make sure they are set up will all the right access prior to the session 
- In bigger team, team managers can be responsible for onboarding. BI preps a training doc for the high level Looker overview and then the data champion in the team guides through Looker - which is often specific by team  

### Evangelize BI
Monthly updates with new data / features in Looker Main purpose here is that people find common things they weren’t aware of and now can use. Example framework of such a newsletter: 
- What’s new
- How can you find and use it?
- What's coming by when?

Really sell the results you’re getting – at all hands and in emails. You want to be able to ask anyone what meaningful achievement you did lately and they should be able to answer this for you.  

Have a dedicated Looker Slack channel where any new updates are listed to keep the business informed on what is happening. Tag relevant people. 

### User feedback
Gather user feedback from end users to increase the value that Looker adds. Send this to inactive users
- Has Looker been useful to you? If not, what could we add or change that would make it more useful?
- Have you experienced anything frustrating or confusing in Looker that I could help with?
- Do you have any other questions or requests about Looker or data at the company more broadly?

### Data champions
Create a hub and spoke model where each team has data champions
- They can: support with training, business analytics support, answering questions on Slack, minimal changes to LookML, and drive adoption in their teams. 
- They arise organically because they are keen on diving in data and gathering data for their respective teams. Keen an eye out via the Looker user engagement dashboards 	
- We will provide them with the support they need and we’ll hold regular feedback session and get their input to guide our roadmap. E.g. regular consulting 1:1 work 

### Measure engagement
- Measure Looker engagement in iLooker and proactively reach out to see any changes in engagement or general disengagement. 
- Executive support - Get executives to buy into Looker and have them use it in their meetings 

### Embedding
Get Looker into the lives of our end users. 
- Schedule data from Looker with our end users 
- Embed Looker (iFrames) into the tools that end users are already using (e.g. Wiki)

## User adoption techniques when user adoption is hard
Replace the reports of your stakeholders - work with them on building out the solution. Key here might be to really first just replicate what they have even when it's not perfect. This will win over their trust
- Email team leads: we are doing BI and would like to see how your team uses data and see if we can support in any way. Support could come in automation of reports to reduce load on team 
- Meet with team leads and look at all reports done in last 3 monhts 
- Meet with report owners and shadow them. Clarify how automation can help
- Get access to the reports and aim to automate this. If we can't, it's an item for the backlog
- Regularly communicate and build the relationship with the stakeholder during this process
- Optional: Evolve the report. You have full understanding of the data. Can this report be improved in any way? Make it more accurate, comprehensive and impactful - which may also mean that reports can change KPIs because something else is more impactful 
- Optional: Start to build out insights. Start off by adding comments to an email used to send reports. Proactively answer questions that your stakeholders always seem to have. Then layer on more robust analysis that builds off the existing report. This is evolving yourself into a trusted partner
