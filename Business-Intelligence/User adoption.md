# User adoption

## Elements of user adoption

### Data availability
Make sure that Looker has the data available for end users so they can answer their questions. This often means helping the business out by building initial dashboards 

### Data reliability
Make sure that end users can trust the data in Looker is reliable. Especially at the start we need to ensure the source data and Looker matches, otherwise people might lose trust

### User Experience
Make Looker easy to use for end users. 

### Support
Provide great support to end users. 
- Have a dedicated channel used for Looker questions
- Make sure response times are practically instant
- Create custom homepages for end users with links to helpful documents. The homepage can also have the main KPIs compared to target and with last six months trended with really strong drill down functionality 
- Emphasize that people can reach out for more training, check their work or sit together and build something 

### Onboarding
Set up training sessions specific to the requirements of the end user to be trained. Train early and often
- Train them day one of joining to make sure Looker is directly ingrained in their habits and workflows 
- Show end users what is possible in Looker - show dashboards we built for others and show how we explore from what already exists in Looker and show ‘Looker Blocks’ with dashboards that relate to their function
- Provide great documentation (training recordings / slides, FAQs, data dictionary) and make this easily available to end users. For developers, have a best practice LookML document 
- Regularly check in with new users as they go through the change curve to ensure they remain enthusiastic and positive about what Looker can provide them. Track their usage in iLooker.

### Evangelize BI
Monthly updates with new data / features in Looker Main purpose here is that people find common things they weren’t aware of and now can use. Example framework of such a newsletter: 
- What’s new
- How can you find and use it?
- What's coming by when?

Really sell the results you’re getting – at all hands and in emails. You want to be able to ask anyone what meaningful achievement you did lately and they should be able to answer this for you.  

### User feedback
Gather user feedback from end users to increase the value that Looker adds. Send this to inactive users
- Has Looker been useful to you? If not, what could we add or change that would make it more useful?
- Have you experienced anything frustrating or confusing in Looker that I could help with?
- Do you have any other questions or requests about Looker or data at the company more broadly?

### Data champions
Create a hub and spoke model where each team has data champions. 
- They arise organically because they are keen on diving in data and gathering data for their respective teams 	
- We will provide them with the support they need and we’ll hold regular feedback session and get their input to guide our roadmap. E.g. regular consulting 1:1 work 

### Measure engagement
- Measure Looker engagement in iLooker and proactively reach out to see any changes in engagement or general disengagement. 
- Executive support - Get executives to buy into Looker and have them use it in their meetings 

### Embedding
Get Looker into the lives of our end users. 
- Schedule data from Looker with our end users 
- Embed Looker (iFrames) into the tools that end users are already using (e.g. Wiki)

## User adoption techniques when user adoption is hard
1. Replace the reports of your stakeholders
    - Email team leads: we are doing BI and would like to see how your team uses data and see if we can support in any way. Support could come in automation of reports to reduce load on team 
    - Meet with team leads and look at all reports done in last 3 monhts 
    - Meet with report owners and shadow them. Clarify how automation can help
    - Get access to the reports and aim to automate this. If we can't, it's an item for the backlog
    - Regularly communicate and build the relationship with the stakeholder during this process
