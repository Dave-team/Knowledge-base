## Starting a new job
- Create a 90 day plan with priorities, goals and milestones. Gets this approved by your boss. When you prepare, think about what you want to get done day 1, day 2, week 1, month 1, month 2, month 3. Ideally set up specific success criteria here
- Key deliverables in the first stage should be: 
    - Good understanding of the business
    - Early wins secured that are in line with the long term value I'll bring and they should be in line with the 90 day plan.
    - Groundwork of useful relationships are built 
- Have regular catch-ups with your boss to go through the progress being made 
- Building initial relationships that help establish credibility 
    - Meet with key stakeholders and take initiative here. Build relationships accross the entire organization  
    - Discuss who you are, the value and goals you represent, your style and how you plan to conduct business.

- Promote yourself. Have a goal in mind around how you'd like to be perceived. This includes having a pith 

## Pitch example
From: “I am helping teams reaching their objectives by making using their data”. 

To: “Most teams are currently struggling with their analytics. The data sits in Google Sheets, doing the analysis is taking a lot of time and most teams are not currently getting the most value from their analysis. What I will help you with is getting a centralized solution in place, that combines the data from the various source systems. All your reports will then sit in a BI tool that gets automatically updated. The benefits include:
- You can analyse more things as we bring various sources together and we can combine data from these sources
- Creating your reports goes from hours to seconds 
- Because it’s centralized, there won’t be any differences between definitions and calculations, meaning that teams won’t be reporting on different numbers for the same things. Practical introductions to new company:

## Job negotiation
### Principles
- Companies don’t look at your salary – they look at the total compensation package. Increasing your salary by 8% really is not a big deal for companies – partly because of the large costs anyway  
- Negotiating never makes an offer worse. Therefore, have a commitment strategy: by principle, negotiate all offers. 
- Companies get invested in hiring you once they spent substantial time with you (interviews, tests, etc.). They’re invested not only time, but also money. Realize they want you and you can ask for some more
- Aim to do your negotiation over email – things are directly in writing and it gives you time to really think through the process 
- What you’re negotiating for is a total compensation package, consisting of base salary, equity, signing bonus, and annual bonus (and benefits). 
- In the negotiation, make sure to keep emphasizing how happy you are to be have the opportunity to join the company 
- Know your desired, expected and minimal amount you'd be willing to accept 

### Negotiation tactics
- Don't give them your salary: 
    - A previous salary isn't representative of current skills 
    - Salary indications on website: write N/A
    - When asked for expectations clarify that you want to make sure there is a mutual fit first 
    - If they insists: “From my research and past experience, my understanding is a base salary of $95k to $120k is standard, but I’m most interested in the fit with the position and overall compensation package.”
- When you get a reasonable offer, add 10% (no specific reason why you’re the one) to 20% (there is a reason why you’re the one) higher
- Take time to think about the offer and say that a second person is involved to decide with (e.g. family / spouse)
-	The easiest way to negotiate is to have competing offers from multiple companies

### Templates 
**Expected salary**
"I want to make sure there is a mutual good fit between yourself and the company and then I'm sure we can agree on the terms"

**Wanting more**
"I am enthusiastic about the idea of working with you, provided we can agree on the terms"
"That is a bit lower than I had in mind but with the right benefits I think it could work. What is the benefits package? Make it 30 days and I we have a deal"
"That is lower than I had in mind. Do you have any flexibility on that number?"
"I was more looking in the direction of X, is this something that works for you?"

Negotiate on salary first: mention that what they’re offering is too low considering what you’ve been able to do at other companies and considering the range you know these roles are going for. Mention the number you’re looking to get and make them match is as close as possible. If they come closer but not perfect, mention total compensation package and negotiate on things like bonus, stock and finally, make sure that you can get an extended review cycle.
