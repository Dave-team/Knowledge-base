# Career

## Mindset 
Seperate your value as a person from your what is going on at work. Detach myself from caring about the outcome and I avoid getting invested emotionally in the job. Life is short and we want to perform well at work but we shouldn't take it all too seriously because in the grand scheme of things, it just doesn't matter as much. It's definitely not intended to have a major impact on your mental health. My primiary purpose in life now is happiness. Worrying about work is not adding to this happiness at all. So either fix the issue, communicate about the problem, think about the solution but don't overthink and go around in circles of anxiety. That holds no purpose

## Overcoming imposter syndrome 
Imposted Syndrome is not feeling good enough in what I do. I am stuck on something - surely I should be able to fix this quickly? This is taking me so long, they'll think I don't my stuff. 
- Wherever we are, we will feel some level of imposter syndrome. Otherwise we're not challenged enough. Simply trust that over time, I will get better at all the things and will be able to figure it out / perform better. 
- Be confident and belief in own performance:
  - My work has high impact and I'm working on the right priorities at the right time. If I feel like I'm not doing the right thing, then I might need to take a step back and refocus to the highest priority work that needs doing. If something is taking me a long time, it's because it's complex and I care about quality - I will have informed the stakeholders.
  - I have the technical ability and when I don't, I know that I have the ability to pick it up rapidly or I can ask others for help.
  - I have the business understanding and when I don't, I know how to get it by communicating with the right stakeholders. 
- Come off it: you're probably feeling more important than I am. You're trying to match some perfection that never actually existed. Letting go of some of your excess self-importance will go a long way. Just expose yourself - you're not perfect and nobody expects you to. 
- Realize that I portray the approval of others - I portray what they may think and it might also be me telling myself I'm doing the wrong things. But that belief is what I'm telling myself, it is not real. Unless I believe I am doing the right things, nobody else will believe it. And this confidence is extremely crucial to get ahead in life / career. 
- Realize I'm my own most harsh critic - others don't expect perfection. 
- It's okay and expected that we all make mistakes. They're great opportunties to learn
- Realize no one is perfect and there is no way you're ever going to know everything and that's okay. Admit mistakes, ask for help and admit you don't know things.
- Adopt the growth mindset: view obstacles as opportunities to learn, get better and improve rather than proof that you're not good enough. Essentially, your feeling of inadequacy is a signal that you’re being challenged. To really become a great developer, you need to embrace that challenge and actually seek it out. View it as an opportunity to learn, to become better, and to grow.
- Keep track of your accomplishments. Regularly reflect on your successes and remind you of how far you’ve come and how good you really are. Write down all accomplishments at the end of a month - whatever learning experiences you had (can also include faillures). More regularly, reflect on past accomplishments and understand how these make you feel. Accept that you have had some role in your successes. 
- Somethings, things don't go as expected or we make mistakes. That's okay. You're still working on the right thing and you know that you will overcome the challenges thrown at you. Know that you always work on the main priorities - sometimes unforeseen work is priority. Sometimes we need to fix our own mistakes. This pushes other projects away and that's fine. Sometimes a roadmap planning is unrealistic. 
- Find out how your manager thinks you’re doing: Imposter syndrome thrives when all you do is think. One of the things you need to do is get out of your own head to combat imposter syndrome. Your manager is the person who has control over your job and getting their input on how you’re doing is essential for getting a realistic view of your skills and effectiveness. Discuss: 
  - What do they feel you’re doing well? Make sure you keep doing this.
  - Is there anything specific they feel you need to work on in the short-term? If so, what measurable goals can you both set to determine success?
  - What longer-term (3-6 months), measurable goals can you both set that will indicate success to your manager? This is useful when you’re just starting with a new company or on a new team to calibrate your progress expectations to theirs’.
- A career is built step by step. Nobody expects me to do things perfectly and gradually doing things and fully understanding them is the best way to learn. 
- Projects are built from the foundation - don’t rush to an outcome. The most important decision is the approach that could eventually lead to the outcome. Make an initial approach and then discuss the approach with others where relevant. 
- Make sure to take enough steps back and to have a relaxed approach to work. If I want to solve all problems at once, my performance on individual projects will suffer. Approach work calmly - if something is not good enough, someone will tell me and we can work on it 
- Step away from the feeling that you need to know everything at once. You don’t. You clarify things to the best of your ability without going to deep into things and then you try things step by step. You cannot anticipate everything in advance and nobody expects you to. As you work, mistakes happen, new insights can be found that change things and then we need to reconsider our approach. 

## Team meetings 
- Understand the purpose
  - The fundamental goal is to bring value to the company. Take myself out of the equation - What I say doesn't matter - did the work get done? That's what matters and I just communicate that. It's about each person bringing clarity to what is happening that might also impact others and giving people an opportunity to add context, become aware of things happening and steer where help is required. 
  - Realise that everyone involved wants me to do well. If it wouldn't have been going well, I'd have know in advance of the meeting. 
- Love what you do, be proud of your work and be enthusiastic to communicate around what you're doing - be grateful for it. 
- In the meeting, step outside of your head and approach the meeting by wanting to provide value: 
  - Be interested and listen to what others are saying - what can I get from that that impact me?
  - You will have questions and context and recommendations or just fun things to say - say these things even when it's not your turn. Great communicators want to speak
- I represent my own brand and want to provide value and impact at all times. Being able to public speak or communicate is essential for this. If I feel anxious because I feel like I didn't do enough - work harder. 
- After every presentation, realize that it didn't matter as much and people didn't actually care that much. 
- Aim to know the people in the company well - from all teams and all seniority. This will help being less anxious as you kind of know how the'll respond. 
- Always focus on the positives during these meetings
- We're all in this together and learning. 
- Other tips: 
  - If I can engage in the discussions early on, my nerves should slowly move away as a connection has been built with e.g. the audience. 
  - Make sure to also slow down during these meetings to allow others to jump in. 
  - Write my notes on paper rather than digital
  - Don't prepare to the point of memorizing 
  - Remind yourself that a calm mind would allow me to present with more clarity as I'll be focused on providing value to those in the sessions as opposed to being selfishly stuck in my own mind.
  - Just take it easy
  - Track the things you're doing during the week to avoid not knowing what to say 
  - Separate your personality and life from your work. I speak for the work I did, not for myself.
  - It's just part of the job 
  - I always perform to the best of my ability and that's all I can do. 
  - Focus on breathing and slowing down to ensure the message comes across  
  
## Non team meetings
- Do your homework
- Know your position in the conversation and what value you can bring. If not sure, ask before attending
- Ask whatever you want to ask. They know I’m not stupid, I’m just not as knowledgeable about this area perhaps 
- Listen well and ask good questions when everyone else is focused on speaking
- Again, it’s not personal - it’s about doing the best for the company and it’s actually critical for me to speak up as this is what I will be paid for 

## Be more valuable 
**For the company** 
- Develop new ideas and deliver end to end that have a positive impact on the business. 
    - This can be on a strategic business level
    - This can be an improved to our infrastructure or how the team operates 
- Automate things to increase quality and save time 
- Improve any ineffiencies you find
- Earn trust and build cross functional relationships that help getting buy in and help move projects forward. It also helps getting a name for yourself where people start considering: we should ask Dave. To do this: 
    - Help those around you in whatever way you can.
    - Get to know the functions, what they do on a daily basis, their pain points. If not to help them then at least to empathize with them.
- Problem solving 
    - Coming up with creative solutions to business problems 
    - Being able to take a complex project and translating that to a clear actionable action plan
    - Have the resourcefulness and confidence to bring projects across the finish line independently
- Focus on contribution to the business

**For yourself and the team**
- Become really good with the tools of your trade 
- Document everything you have worked on which comes in handy for review time
- Continiously work on documentation. You and others will need it. Make sure you remember why you did things so record your decisioning somewhere (e.g. clear comments in SQL logic)
- Really understand the data 
- Implement best practices and educate the business on best practices where needed 
- Focus on key skills and strenghts rather than trying to solve for weaknesses
- Your role should be aligned with your personality. “This is how it should be done. You want me for this role and this is who I am”. 

## Be curious
- Google around Snowflake, DBT, Fivetran, Looker etc
- Google around practical data science use cases, such as experimentation, forecasting, predictive analytics
- Stay up to date with release notes
- Think about what metrics are relevant for different industries / functions / use cases. Also, how to decide on metrics to track when running different tests?  
- Search for good ETL examples where actual SaaS data is extracted from APIs
- Find some great datasets online and play with them
- Find great analysis online and understand them and replicate to practice

## Starting a new job
- Create a 90 day plan with priorities, goals and milestones. Gets this approved by your boss. When you prepare, think about what you want to get done day 1, day 2, week 1, month 1, month 2, month 3. Ideally set up specific success criteria here
- Key deliverables in the first stage should be: 
    - Good understanding of the business
    - Early wins secured that are in line with the long term value I'll bring and they should be in line with the 90 day plan.
    - Groundwork of useful relationships are built 
- Have regular catch-ups with your boss to go through the progress being made 
- Building initial relationships that help establish credibility 
    - Meet with key stakeholders and take initiative here. Build relationships accross the entire organization  
    - Discuss who you are, the value and goals you represent, your style and how you plan to conduct business. 
    - Prepare the agenda and get to know their objectives, processes and goals. 
    - First impressions are important 
    - Use an org chart to help familiraize with the company 
- Promote yourself. Have a goal in mind around how you'd like to be perceived. This includes having a pitch 
- Get to know what people care about and how communication works 
  - Get a good understanding of the most important metrics used in the business. Look at existing dashboards and analysis 
  - Understand the roadmap
  - Become very familiar with the tools 
  - Look into previous PRs and Slack announcementss 
- When starting a new role, first understand why things are done a certain way. Only then consider whether the business would be positively impacted by a change. Don’t come in and change things because you have seen something done a certain way in the past. Rather, learn about the current processes long enough to identify its pains and strengths. Then work with the team to evaluate whether change is required. This will massively increase credibility. Really stop and listen to what is happening and go on the learning curve as quickly as possible. Potentially make a learning plan for this. Ask ‘how did you get to this point’? Why are things done this way? Are these reasons still valid? Are things changing such that we might need to change to meet current requirements?   
- The skills and ways of working of previous roles don't always transfer to a new role. You need to adept.

## Pitch example
Intro to company: 

Hi everyone. My name is Dave and I;m very excited to join Papier in these challenging times. I'll be joining Will and Ibu in the BI team. As you might be able to tell from my accent, I am Dutch from origin and I've been in London for 4.5 years now. Prior to Papier I was at Tessian where I set up the BI function and I;m very excited to meet you all in the coming weeks!

When asked the question 'where were you before?' the answer is: I was at Tessian, which is an email security company. They protect business such as law and financial firms from internal and external email threats using machine learning. 

From: “I am helping teams reaching their objectives by making using their data”. 

To: “Most teams are currently struggling with their analytics. The data sits in Google Sheets, doing the analysis is taking a lot of time and most teams are not currently getting the most value from their analysis. What I will help you with is getting a centralized solution in place, that combines the data from the various source systems. All your reports will then sit in a BI tool that gets automatically updated. The benefits include:
- You can analyse more things as we bring various sources together and we can combine data from these sources
- Creating your reports goes from hours to seconds 
- Because it’s centralized, there won’t be any differences between definitions and calculations, meaning that teams won’t be reporting on different numbers for the same things. Practical introductions to new company:

## Job negotiation
### Principles
- Companies don’t look at your salary – they look at the total compensation package. Increasing your salary by 8% really is not a big deal for companies – partly because of the large costs anyway  
- Negotiating never makes an offer worse. Therefore, have a commitment strategy: by principle, negotiate all offers. 
- Companies get invested in hiring you once they spent substantial time with you (interviews, tests, etc.). They’re invested not only time, but also money. Realize they want you and you can ask for some more
- Aim to do your negotiation over email – things are directly in writing and it gives you time to really think through the process 
- What you’re negotiating for is a total compensation package, consisting of base salary, equity, signing bonus, and annual bonus (and benefits). 
- In the negotiation, make sure to keep emphasizing how happy you are to be have the opportunity to join the company 
- Know your desired, expected and minimal amount you'd be willing to accept 
- After given an offer, mention that you need more time and will respond with an email 
- Be willing to walk away. Mention that you're still ikn talks with other companies and would only consider the role if the package is met 

### Negotiation tactics
- Don't give them your salary (it gives them a benchmark that's too easy): 
    - A previous salary isn't representative of current skills 
    - Salary indications on website: write N/A
    - When asked for expectations clarify that you want to make sure there is a mutual fit first 
    - If they insists: “From my research and past experience, my understanding is a base salary of $95k to $120k is standard, but I’m most interested in the fit with the position and overall compensation package.”
- When you get a reasonable offer, add 10% (no specific reason why you’re the one) to 20% (there is a reason why you’re the one) higher
- Take time to think about the offer and say that a second person is involved to decide with (e.g. family / spouse)
- The easiest way to negotiate is to have competing offers from multiple companies

### Templates 
**Expected salary**
"I want to make sure there is a mutual good fit between yourself and the company and then I'm sure we can agree on the terms"

**Wanting more**
"I am enthusiastic about the idea of working with you, provided we can agree on the terms"
"That is a bit lower than I had in mind but with the right benefits I think it could work. What is the benefits package? Make it 30 days and I we have a deal"
"That is lower than I had in mind. Do you have any flexibility on that number?"
"I was more looking in the direction of X, is this something that works for you?"

Negotiate on salary first: mention that what they’re offering is too low considering what you’ve been able to do at other companies and considering the range you know these roles are going for. Mention the number you’re looking to get and make them match is as close as possible. If they come closer but not perfect, mention total compensation package and negotiate on things like bonus, stock and finally, make sure that you can get an extended review cycle. 

## Achievements doc
This is very helpful to keep track of what you've accomplished in your role, it should be used during performance reviews and it gives great understanding of what you like doing, want to more/less of

### Goals
List your goals for the year and for the quarter here. Everything should ultimately tie back to this

### Projects
For each one, go through: 
- What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which components did you build? Was there some useful insight like “wait, we can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work” that you came up with?)
- The impact of the project – who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals? Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit? helped retain an important user?)

### Collaboration & mentorship
Examples of things in this category:
- Helping others in an area you’re an expert in 
- Mentoring interns / helping new team members get started
- Foundational code that other people built on top of
- Improving monitoring / dashboards / on call
- Any code review that you spent a particularly long time on / that you think was especially important
- Important questions you answered
- Mentoring someone on a project 
- Giving an internal talk or workshop

### Design & documentation
- List design docs & documentation that you worked on, why you worked on them and their impact

### Company building
This is anything not directly related to your role but other things that you supported with. Some things that go in here:
- Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting, etc)
- Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better onboarding materials

### What you learned
Try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently. Some examples of skills you might be learning or improving:
- how to do performance analysis & make code run faster
- internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
- how to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
- about a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
- an area like product management / UX design
- how to write a clear design doc
- a new programming language

### Outside of work
It’s also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:
- blog posts
- talks/panels
- open source work
- Industry recognition

## Work goals
- Become really at the Snowflake / DBT / Looker stack - including some funky DBT Jinja as I'm still quite overwhelmed with what I see in the Slack channels 
- Get all-round in data and be able to answer machine learning questions (either myself, outsouring or hiring)
- Get a really deep and good understanding of clickstream and marketing data (how data is collected, how to test for this, how are user IDs combined etc.)
- Become proficient at Git in a team setting between DBT and Looker
- To the extend relevant, get a good understanding of the AWS ecosystem to allow making decisions depending on the goal
- Get management experience

Work specific 
- Think through second order effects. When making assumptions, stress test them and think where they could break. 
- Just engage with people. Hey we haven’t met yet. I’m dave. Or when someone else comes in hey how’s it going? When they sit close to you also just regularly during the day
- Don't assume you know the logic behind things when the logic isn't on the lowest level. Instead, verify. 
- Only ask questions when you can’t figure out something yourself. Default should be to be investigative yourself
- Don’t be upset about what others say just because they say something have the confidence to stick through your plan and only when you’re stuck ask for help . If something will take considerate time or you're not completely sure, sense check your approach

## Aanounce your work / seel your projects
- Explain the goals (why is this gonna be awesome?)
- Explain who’s affected by the project
- Maybe talk about the risks a little
- Talk a little about timelines

A few reasons announcing plans is useful:
- Everyone else is trying to plan their work all the time. If I announce what I’m planning, that helps people who are working on related projects! For example, my team just announced a project that interacts a lot with another team’s work, so that team is going to allocate someone to work on it!
- If we advertise a plan maybe someone will notice an important problem with it and tell us!
- Writing a plan forces your clarify your goals
- Communicating clear plans helps management… manage.
- I think announcing ambitious plans can help kind of.. inspire the people around you? Like I sometimes see that someone else is kicking off a Very Important Project and I think, wow, that’s really cool, maybe we can do something cool like that.
- It’s exciting to see people starting and finishing projects, like it creates momentum for the whole company if everyone talks about what they’re doing!
