# Business principles to live by
## Speed matters
- Don't wait and ask: what can be done now? Walk up > Slack > Call > Email
- Don’t aim for perfection – aim for making it good enough
- Build incrementally: build, launch, get feedback, repeat 

## Do the right thing
- Get a good problem definition
- Write down your thinking
- Ask yourself:
    - Are we doing the right thing / answering the right question?
    - Do we not already have the answer elsewhere? 
    - Is it worth pursuing? 
    - Can we make it simpler?
-  Check in with others to stress test your thinking


## Quality matters
- Always test things when you implement a change. Don’t make a change but then don’t confirm that it works

## Solve problems
Solve a problem by asking: could it be X? Then try X and see if it works. Think if I can fix it before asking others or before thinking it can’t be done. 

## Be flexible
- Things change. Be ready to adapt

## Keep things simple
Do the bare minimum to solve the problem.
