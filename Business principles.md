# Business principles 
## My guidelines
- Speed matters: work fast and do things right now - don't delay 
- Quality matters: never assume and always check
- Be flexible: things will always change. Be prepared to adapt.
- Keep things simple: do the bare minimum to solve the problem. 
- Work incrementally: build, launch, get feedback, repeat 
- Be consistent in performance

## Think strategically 
- Define the problem and what decision needs to be made
- What are we trying to accomplish? What is the goal?
- Do we need to do it? Is it a big enough thing to solve?
- Are we doing the right thing / answering the right question?
- Do we need to do it now?
- Do we have something similar already that might do the same thing?
- Can we do it better (more efficient, less costs, simpler)
- Can we do something else? Always be ready to elaborate on different approaches you considered
- Especially when deeply involved in a project, take these steps back and look at the issue holistically 
- What are the risks involved and how can we mitigate those? Think about
    - Known-knowns: project scope and requirements
    - Known-unknowns: recognised risks to the project
    - Unknown-unknowns: where we get blind-sided - things we don't know and might hit us 
    - Unknown-knowns: bad assumptions, the things you think you know but actually don't 
- Think about second and subsequent order effects. 
    - What is involved with this decision 
    - How do these things interact? 
    - What effects will the decision have? Think about what might happen if I were wrong
- Check in with others to stress test your thinking and see if there is a better way. Get feedback early and often. Socialising your work will help you refine, develop, and evangelise it. Don't overthink things - ask for help instead
- Remember that I don't need to solve all problems. Often, the problem should be handed to someone else.  
- What would you like to see if you were owner of the company? A good way to think about this is to think of the business as a process. And then think hard how each of these inidividial pieces can be improved. 

## Think critically
- Before escalating, make sure that there aren't any obvious answers to your issues. Asking someone else is often the quickest way to get the necessary info
- Challenge your assumptions 
    - What are some reasons I might be wrong?
    - How do I know this is true?
- Never assume things to be true. Do your own research and confirm. Ask:
    - What does this actually mean?
    - Is that true?  
- Always ask why
- Assess your own thinking - do I think this because I know the facts or because X person thinks this?
- ‘You are not entitled to take a view, unless and until you can argue better against that view than the smartest guy who holds that opposite view.'

## Think structured
- Break down your thinking into small pieces and map it out. Clarify your own thinking by putting it into writing
    - What do I think, exactly?
    - Why do I think that?  
- Reverse engineer by starting with the end in mind 
- Think from first principles. What do we know to be absolutely true and then reason from there. This is very hard as we're taught to reason from convention. 
- Solve each step prior to moving on to the next 
- Map or draw out the situation for better understanding
- Think through problems together with others 

## Think inside their shoes
- What might be their reason for doing things? 
- Always assume that fundamentally, people want to help and assume the best from people. If they don’t get back to you, who knows what might have happened? You don’t control them and they’ll always do what they want 

## Meetings
**Running meetings**
- Define clear objectives before any meeting and make sure the right people are attending 
- Create an agenda and share it within the team attending the meeting
- Have an ending time for any meeting, to avoid off-topics
- Pre meeting: brief about the goal, agenda
- Tips to host a good meeting: 
    - Use the whiteboard to brainstorm, keep track of important items discussed
    - Ask people to close their laptop where possible
    - Lead the meeting and get it back on track if we went on a tangent
    - Conclude agenda points prior to moving on with a decision and an action and the person taking it is onboard and doesn't need any clarification to start working on it 
    - Ask if there are any concerns
- Summarise the action items (SMART)
- Thank the participants 
- Send a follow-up e-mail, with a summary and especially action items specifically outlined (who, what, when) and SMART
- Start the next meeting with the action items of last meeting

**Prep for meeting set by others**
- What is the goal? Why are we doing this? 
- Who is involved and what is their role? 
- What is the agenda? / What will likely be discussed? 
- How can I contribute? 
- What will I present?
- What is the other person looking for?
- What questions could this raise?
- Do I fully understand what I am presenting or do I need some more info from someone? 
- Do I know the reasons behind we did things in a certain way? 
- Prepare questions that I want to ask also 
- Scout first: Do everything you can to avoid a meeting where you don’t know what the stakeholders expect from you. A quick 5-minute sit-down a few days before the “real” meeting goes a long way to making sure everyone is on the same page when the meeting happens.

## Problem solving / Decision making
- Solve a problem by asking: could it be X? Then try X and see if it works. Think if I can fix it before asking others or before thinking it can’t be done. 
- When dealing with a hard problem, let it be and sleep on it to get support from the subconscious mind 
- Do not ever forget to know your reasons for why you made a decision. Every time you make a decision, write down your reasons for the decision. Document the underlying thoughts
- Research everything you don't know. Think in terms of models you understand

**Helpful tactics**
- Scoring model when evaluation larger decisions 
- Pros and cons 
- Costs benefits analysis 
- 5 whys
- Best / Expected / Worst outcome scenario planning
- The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades.
- Systematically assess future risks. Always ask yourself: what if the project failed. Please explain in 5-10 minutes how we would look back on it. This will really help seeing the identified and unidentified risks

## Other
- Make sure to connect to the right people. Account manager instead of support when things need doing 
- Always be available – but when needing others ask whether they are available 
- Make sure that at standup, everything I will be working on is measurable 
- Speed things up by:
    - Don't wait and ask: what can be done now? Walk up > Slack > Call > Email
    - If we had to actually complete this in two weeks, what would our approach be?
- Always test things when you implement a change. Don’t make a change but then don’t confirm that it works
- Be more of an idea factory - regularly just writing down my ideas 
- Take the lead and initiative
- When making a recommendation, break it down: what does it take to get there? What are our next steps? What are the alternatives? What are the risks? 
- Remind yourself of the goal of your role and see everything in that perspective
- Ideally, you should always have a strategic opinion on matters. And then you're also able to argument for that opinion
- Finding quick solutions to problem: strong critical thinking skills combined with resourcefulness to solve problems. 
- Being able to speak on the spot – i.e. respond to random questions/comments 
- Be proactive
- Take complete ownership
- Give lots of honest feedback
