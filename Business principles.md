# Business principles 
## My guidelines
- Speed matters: work fast and do things right now - don't delay. Don't say you will do, just do first. 
- Quality matters: never assume and always check
- Be flexible: things will always change. Be prepared to adapt.
- Keep things simple: do the bare minimum to solve the problem prior to making things more complex  
- Work incrementally: build, launch, get feedback, repeat. 
- Be consistent in performance

## Think strategically 
- Define the problem and what decision needs to be made
- What are we trying to accomplish? What is the goal?
- Do we need to do it? Is it a big enough thing to solve?
- Are we doing the right thing / answering the right question?
- Do we need to do it now?
- Do we have something similar already that might do the same thing?
- Can we do it better (more efficient, less costs, simpler)
- Can we do something else? Always be ready to elaborate on different approaches you considered
- What would this look like it it were easy? 
- Especially when deeply involved in a project, take these steps back and look at the issue holistically 
- What are the risks involved and how can we mitigate those? Think about
    - Known-knowns: project scope and requirements
    - Known-unknowns: recognised risks to the project
    - Unknown-unknowns: where we get blind-sided - things we don't know and might hit us 
    - Unknown-knowns: bad assumptions, the things you think you know but actually don't 
- Think about second and subsequent order effects. 
    - What is involved with this decision 
    - How do these things interact? 
    - What effects will the decision have? Think about what might happen if I were wrong. Think about how this would impact different parties 
    - What are the consequences of this decisions in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years 
- Check in with others to stress test your thinking and see if there is a better way. Get feedback early and often. Socialising your work will help you refine, develop, and evangelise it. Don't overthink things - ask for help instead
- Remember that I don't need to solve all problems. Often, the problem should be handed to someone else.  
- What would you like to see if you were owner of the company? A good way to think about this is to think of the business as a process. And then think hard how each of these inidividial pieces can be improved. 
- Improve abstract thinking by studying mathematics and philosophy 

## Think critically
- Before escalating, make sure that there aren't any obvious answers to your issues. Asking someone else is often the quickest way to get the necessary info
- Think about the questions nobody is asking: really consider 'what does this actually do?' and then consider: 'what scenarios might not be in line with this and potentially break?'
- Challenge your assumptions 
    - Why am I assuming this?
    - What are some reasons I might be wrong?
    - How do I know this is true?
- Never assume things to be true. Do your own research and confirm. Ask:
    - What does this actually mean? Are there any other meanings this could have?
    - Is that true?  
- Always ask why
- Assess your own thinking - do I think this because I know the facts or because X person thinks this?
- Always consider alternative ways of doing things. Your solution is one way - how else could it be done? 
- ‘You are not entitled to take a view, unless and until you can argue better against that view than the smartest guy who holds that opposite view.'
- Socratic questioning
    - Clarification – "What do you mean by...?". Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
    - Probing assumptions – "What could we assume instead?". Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
    - Probing reasons/evidence – "Why do you think this is true?". Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
    - Implications and consequences – "What effect would that have?". Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
    - Different viewpoints – "What would be an alternative?". Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
    - Questioning the original question – "What was the point of this question?" Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)

## Think structured
- Break down your thinking into small pieces and map it out. Clarify your own thinking by putting it into writing
    - What do I think, exactly?
    - Why do I think that?  
- Reverse engineer by starting with the end in mind 
- Think from first principles. What do we know to be absolutely true and then reason from there. This is very hard as we're taught to reason from convention / by analogy. 
- Solve each step prior to moving on to the next 
- Map or draw out the situation for better understanding
- Think through problems together with others 
- Type out your thoughts process to help improve and structure thoughts 
- What did I ignore or didn't pay attention to? 

## Think inside their shoes
- What might be their reason for doing things? 
- Always assume that fundamentally, people want to help and assume the best from people. If they don’t get back to you, who knows what might have happened? You don’t control them and they’ll always do what they want 
- What else might this mean?

## Meetings
**Preparation**
- Define clear objectives before any meeting and make sure the right people are attending. Meetings are expensive so ensure only the right people attend; consider whether a meeting is even required. 
- Those people that need to attend, make sure they do. If they can't, make sure there is a representative in their place. 
- Create an agenda and share it within the team attending the meeting
  - Date 
  - Invites (potentially with the role they're expected to play during the meeting)
  - Topics. Always be specific when setting these
  - AOB

**Prep for meeting set by others**
- What is the goal? Why are we doing this? 
- Who is involved and what is their role? 
- What is the agenda? / What will likely be discussed? 
- How can I contribute? 
- What will I present?
- What is the other person looking for?
- What questions could this raise?
- Do I fully understand what I am presenting or do I need some more info from someone? 
- Do I know the reasons behind we did things in a certain way? 
- Prepare questions that I want to ask also 
- Review notes last meeting 
- Scout first: Do everything you can to avoid a meeting where you don’t know what the stakeholders expect from you. A quick 5-minute sit-down a few days before the “real” meeting goes a long way to making sure everyone is on the same page when the meeting happens.

**Running meetings**
- Pre meeting: brief about the goal, agenda
- Start the next meeting with the action items of last meeting
- Tips to host a good meeting: 
    - Use the whiteboard to brainstorm, keep track of important items discussed
    - Ask people to close their laptop where possible
    - Lead the meeting and get it back on track if we went on a tangent. Remember the end time for any meeting, to avoid off-topics
    - Conclude agenda points prior to moving on with a decision and an action and the person taking it is onboard and doesn't need any clarification to start working on it 
    - Ask if there are any concerns
- Summarise the action items (SMART)
- Thank the participants 
- General:
  - Provide more input
  - Determine in advance who leads the meeting
  - IF I miss context: Say ‘I wasn’t part of the discussions - can we quickly recap what we;re trying to achieve here?
- To discuss in catch-ups meetings: 
  - What are we all working on? 
  - Are there any questions / things we can help with? 
  - We have been thinking about doing X - is this something you would be interested in? We’re still very early stage and just gathering feedback. Think about: AI applications, what more can we build thats good for the business? 

**Minutes**
- Date
- Invites
- Previous To-Dos 
- New To-Dos
- Meeting notes: 
  - Discussion summary 
  - Decisions made
  - Actions to be taken: what, what, when.
- Consider the RAID method: Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions
- Consider taking minutes during the meeting whilst everyone can see what is being typed 
- When a meeting is longer or more complicated, ask two other to also take notes so you have a backup for when you are busy interacting with others

**Follow-up**
- Send a follow-up e-mail, with a summary and especially action items specifically outlined (who, what, when) and SMART

## Problem solving / Decision making
- Make sure to fully understand the issue instead of making assumptions. Research everything you don't know. Write things down as you learn them to get a full picture of the problem 
- Think about the real problem to solve. This is can be different from what others say - don't just parrot people.
- Understand how important it is - "How important is this, really?" 
- Do we have the solution or something similar from the past already? 
- Is there a different way of doing it? 
- Scientific method. Why are hypotheses for an issue? Then try the most obvious potential reasons first and see if it works. Narrow the list of hypothesis down as fast as possible. Think if I can fix it before asking others or before thinking it can’t be done. 
- When dealing with a hard problem, let it be and sleep on it to get support from the subconscious mind. It's the 'obsess and let go strategy'. Work intensely on problem and if there's no progress, let go and do something else to switch the context.   
- If there's time, solve a problem multiple ways and se what works best 
- Do not ever forget to know your reasons for why you made a decision. Every time you make a decision, write down your reasons for the decision. Document the underlying thoughts
- Think about your mistakes: what could you have done differently? What were the signs that you got in that situation?
- Only focus on making the most important decisions, don't spend much time on trivial decisions - reduce as many trivial choices as possible 
- Talk about the problem with others - things can bring in new perspectives that help getting unstuck. Even consider rubber duck debugging. This can help: 
    - Fresh perspective that you probably wouldn't have gotten by just thinking for yourself
    - Learn something new: how would someone else solve the problem you're having? How is their thinking different from yours?
    - Solve the problem quicker. When stuck, things are very inefficient. Interrupting someone for help is net net more efficient 
    - Build relationships with teammates 
    - Learn how to unblock yourself in the future by learning new ways of thinking 
- If you're stuck when debugging a problem, think about all the assumptions you're making, and then test each one of them, no matter how obvious.
- When stuck, take a step back and look at the situation from multiple angels. Realize you might be stuck on a solution and need to think more holistically about the problem 
- Sometimes, we need to step back and work on something with ease, especially when we are stuck on something for a while 
- Improve decision making by doing feedback analysis. Each time you make a decision, write down what you expect to happen. 12 months later, look into what you expected and try to understand the difference 
- Make as few as possible decisions - focus on the most critical ones only.
- Sometimes it’s okay to tell people that there is no way for us to figure things out entirely. And if we are confident we are doing things in an expected way, we should just communicate that. 
- Write down your decision making process every time is decision is to be made. 

**Helpful tactics**
- Scoring model when evaluation larger decisions. Also called a decision matrix where we list options, score/weight and then rank them 
- Pros and cons 
- Brainstorming sessions 
- Costs benefits analysis 
- 5 whys
- Best / Expected / Worst outcome scenario planning
- The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades.
- Systematically assess future risks. Always ask yourself: what if the project failed. Please explain in 5-10 minutes how we would look back on it. This will really help seeing the identified and unidentified risks
- Issue trees: maps of problems
    - Problem tree: 
        - Break the problem down into branches
        - Branches are MECE: mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. Mutually exclusive means there is no overlap between different parts of the tree. Collectively exhaustive means they cover the whole problem.
    - Solution tree
        - Focus on the most impactful parts of the problem
        - Map categories of the solution
        - Brainstrom / generate ideas to improve in those categories 

**Peter Drucker decision making process**
- Ask: "Is this a generic situation or an exception?" If generic/more often occuring, answer through a rule / principles. If exception, handle it as it comes
- Clear specifications as to what the decision has to accomplish. What are the objectives the decision has to reach? What are the minimum goals it has to attain? What are the conditions it has to satisfy? A decision needs to be adequate to its purpose.
- Convert into action
  - Who has to know of this decision? 
  - What action has to be taken? 
  - Who is to take it? 
  - And what does the action have to be so that the people who have to do it can do it? 
- Finally, a feedback has to be built into the decision to provide a continual testing, against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the decision.

## Other
- Make sure to connect to the right people. Account manager instead of support when things need doing 
- If there is confusion, jump on a call rather than going back on forth over Slack. Once something becomes even slightly complex to explain, take the step back and jump on a call. 
- Realize that I will often be wrong - don’t be too steadfast and sure around knowing the right answer for sure. Again, if there is confusion, jump on a call. Listen to the other person’s perspective and then use data / test things to understand where the right solution is. If it doesn’t matter, have it the other person’s way. 
- Always be available – but when needing others ask whether they are available 
- Make sure that at standup, everything I will be working on is measurable 
- Speed things up by:
    - Don't wait and ask: what can be done now? Walk up > Slack > Call > Email
    - If we had to actually complete this in two weeks, what would our approach be?
- Always test things when you implement a change. Don’t make a change but then don’t confirm that it works
- Be more of an idea factory - regularly just writing down my ideas 
- Take the lead and initiative
- When making a recommendation, break it down: what does it take to get there? What are our next steps? What are the alternatives? What are the risks? 
- Remind yourself of the goal of your role and see everything in that perspective
- Ideally, you should always have a strategic opinion on matters. And then you're also able to argument for that opinion
- Finding quick solutions to problem: strong critical thinking skills combined with resourcefulness to solve problems. 
- Being able to speak on the spot – i.e. respond to random questions/comments 
- Be proactive
- Take complete ownership
- Give lots of honest feedback
- Force yourself to slow done before diving into a project. Do research, make sure you understand the problem deeply and document learnings you create for future references. Build mental maps and think ahead. 
- Don't get stuck in a rabbit hole though - focus on a broad generalized concept understanding. When in a rabbit hole, recognise your position. Take a step back. Realize that what you’re obsessed about probably doesn’t matter and then move on
- Under promise and over deliver
- Always confirm things in writing 
- Make use of issue logs and post mortems in projects 
- Be aware of the hype cycle (see below)
- Always come up with a solution or next steps to get to a solution when encountering a problem. 
- Make sure to take risk averse approaches. Think about how things can be impacted and make sure the worst case can't happen before making a change
