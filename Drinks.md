### Terminology
- “Scotch”, properly called ‘Whisky’, is a whisky that has been distilled and aged in Scotland. The Scots spell it whisky and the Irish spell it whiskey, with an extra 'e'. This difference in the spelling comes from the translations of the word from the Scottish and Irish Gaelic forms. Whiskey with the extra 'e' is also used when referring to American whiskies.
- Age - Tthe number just means the youngest age of any whiskey mixed to make that bottle.

**Types of Whisky**
- Single Malt Scotch Whisky means a Scotch Whisky produced from only water and malted barley at a single distillery by batch distillation in pot stills.
- Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (AKA “Vatted” Whisky): a blend of two or more Single Malt Scotch Whiskies from different distilleries.
- Blended Scotch Whisky: a combination of one or more Single Malt Scotch Whiskies with one or more Single Grain Scotch Whiskies
- Blended Grain Scotch Whisky: a blend of two or more Single Grain Scotch Whiskies from different distilleries
- Single Grain Scotch Whisky: a Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery but which, in addition to water and malted barley, may also be produced from whole grains of other malted or unmalted cereals

**More info on single malts**
What is Malt?
Malt is germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develop the enzymes required to modify the grain's starches into sugars. WIKI

Cereal Grains? For Scotch Whisky its Barley. Barley is in the "Grass Family" WIKI. there are other Grains used to make other whiskies, which include: Wheat, Rye, Oats, and Rice. these are used in making a lot of American Whiskies and Bourbons.

So Barley is Malted and dried. It is then mixed with Water. Usually local water where the distillery was purposely placed. Good water is clean and free of metals/minerals.

The soaking and heating of the Malted Barley releases the sugars into the water, this is called Mashing. After which the Mash is fermented and then distilled. This has been oversimplified for now because its only the first lesson.

In the end, a Single Malt means that one Malted Grain, at one Distillery has been used to produced one Malt Whisky or Single Malt Whisky. If a different distillery brought their Single Malt over to another distillery and mixed them together... thats where we get blending. But thats for another lesson.

**More info on blends**
Each whisky blending house will have a master blender whose job it is to ensure that the blend tastes exactly the same from year to year, even if the supplies of one of the whiskies in the blend may not be available or the distillery may not have produced enough.

Why Blend?

Blended Scotch whisky accounts for 90% of the Scotch whisky consumed in the world, making it by far the preferred style of Scotch whisky for most consumers. WHAT? I know right?

Grain Whiskies, because they are light, smooth out the "harsher" Single Malts and make them much more palatable to a wider consumer base. Its that simple. Blends are easier to drink for the casual or newer drinker. Grain whiskies are also way cheaper and easier to produce. Mo money Mo money.

## Tasting 

### General
- Whisky is great because it has an amazing complexity to it. Every single one is different and it's like tasting concentrated flavors that evolve in your mouth.
- Why should you review? It helps you. Sitting down and dissecting a whisky gives you more reward. Casually drinking some is great but you miss a lot. I compare it to watching a movie in a theater vs watching a movie at home with other things going on that distract you.  
- If there is ONE tip that I want you to take away from reading this it is: SLOW DOWN. We as a society scarf our food down way too fast and we hardly ever stop and take the time to dissect what we are eating. When was the last time you were eating a pizza and thought “ooh I can taste the oregano in the sauce”
- Drink tiny amounts; pick it apart. You want to be deliberate about it - then it will develop over time. You’ll get more out of it, the more concentration you put into it. 
- Build your vocabularly by looking at other YouTube videos and by reading reviews

### Tasting process
**Preparation**
- Make sure you have a clean tastebuds to start. E.g. no lingering tastes of different foods, no cold, no burned mouth 
- Be in a relaxed and calm state
- Set up deliberately, without distractions 
- Set up with a notebook to write notes in

**Nosing**
- Hold the glass sideways and rotate the whisky around the inner of the glass, coating it. Don’t swirl. 
- Look at the color in the light, it means nothing but it can be pretty. 
- Stick your nose right in it and whiff. Nose many times to get it trained to smell real smells and not just alcohol. Short breaths long breaths. You can also try putting your nose in and breathing in through your mouth only. That will slow down the intake of smells and get them to sit in your nose a bit longer. 
- The key is to go beyond the initial smell and taste of alcohol and intitial strong smell and taste - you want to discover what's underneath it instead. 
- Then just let your brain go, write down what you think you smell.  Go with the learned vocabulary and pull from your experiences. 
- You might also want something else in the room to counter smell.  If your nose gets too trained to what you are smelling, smell something else for a bit.  

**Tasting**
- You’re trying to get under the alcohol to the actual flavors. To do this, just like I said earlier, do tiny amounts until you build up your tasting skills. Very small amounts because you’re trying to dissect it. 
- Process
  - First I take a nice mouthful (not a lot but decent amount) and “chew it.” Move it around your whole mouth, coat it and then swallow. 
  - Breathe in your mouth and let it sting a tad.
  - Write down what you initially taste no matter what it is, write it fast before it fades.
  - Secondly I take a half amount of the first and swish it around like mouth wash.
  - Thirdly I take a small amount and make a vacuum in my mouth. Push all the air out of your mouth and keep the whisky on the front of your tongue tightly. In the vacuum of your mouth push your tongue forward and backwards very fast and you’ll see what happens. The flavor intensifies dramatically. You’re getting the whisky past your saliva and onto your buds, increasing the surface area and intensity of the whisky on your tongue. 
  - Write whatever your brain says. Be expressive and concise. Go with your gut. Then slow it back down and sip the rest of the dram, taking notes on the way and altering as you go on.  
  - The “finish” is just when you swallow. How does it feel? How long does it last? What sensations are you noticing? It’s a complex drink, and the beginning can be completely different from the ending(finish).
- If you’re having problems being able to dissect it, read reviews from others while you’re tasting and see if you can taste the same things. But don't force their descriptions onto what you’re drinking just because they say it tastes a certain way; use them as a guide and see for yourself. You’ll say "yep, I can taste that" or "nope, I don't think that's there.” 

**How to review**
Basically I take into account an overall quality and enjoyment of Taste/Nose and Balance and Complexity. 

What is Balance?  How harmoniously the flavors/smells work together.  Sometimes the balance can be thrown off by one flavor or smell being overpowering.  When something is really well balanced the complexity in the flavor is really easy to read.  It isn’t a struggle to get notes.  

Complexity?  how many different flavors and smells can you get out of one whisky?  If you get only a couple: simple complexity.  If you get dozens, High complexity. It can be either a straight line simple, or a spiderweb of mixed notes.  Both simple and high complexity can be good or bad, depending on your preferences.  

**Review example**
Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review. Glenfiddich 15. I had a bottle of this when I was first starting out with Scotch, before I started reviews, so I figured I'd be a give it another shot now.
Color: Reddish Brown like the packaging
Nose: Light sweet spice, nutmeg sugar
Taste: malty coca-cola, brown sugar maple, dried cherries and cinnamon
Finish: tangy smooth, medium
for not having it for a year it's pretty much how I remember it. 18 is still my favorite of the Glenfiddich's I've had so far, including Snow Phoenix. Haven't had the 21 yet... maybe it will cross my path. only 80 proof, it could use a little bump. an interesting note about this whisky is the Solera. it is matured in American bourbon, Portuguese sherry and virgin oak. The whisky was then married in a Solera vat.

### Other
**How to drink whiksy**
- Neat - probably best way overall
- On the ricks - melting ice will result in a lot of water
- Few drops of water - this can be helpful to get some aromas out of the whisky or to make a particularly whisky a bit lighter
- Straight up: shaken with ice and then poured into a glass.

**Glassware**
Key is to concentrate the nose for full aromas. Only use a tumbler when adding ice or when you don't care about tasting the whisky. Otherwise, use: 
- Glencairns
- Copta
- Brandy snifter

**Tasting set-up**
- Glenmorangie original or Auchentoshan Classic or - very light and lightly sweet for starters/warmup
- Glenlivet 12 or Glenfiddich 12 - sweeter, crisper, light rich fruit to get into flavors
- Aberlour 12 or Macallan 12 - sweet sherry to push those flavors into a complex realm.
- Bunnahabhain 12 or Highland Park 12 - robust and getting into peat to bridge into the monsters, cragganmore is another good one to bridge.
- Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10 - peat/smoke rich to really shock them. before this level, they may be on board but this is the level that most have the love/hate relationship with.

**Food pairings**
- Glenmorangie Original, Dalwhinnie 15, Tobermorey 10, Macallan 15 fine oak and other lighter sweet mild oak whisky-- pair with lighter baked white fishes like cod or perch or flounder or white tuna. scallops, buttery and light go well together. light cheeses and fruits like mangos
- Macallan 12 sherry, Tomatin, Aberlour 12, Balvenie Single Cask, pig nose and other lighter sherried whisky- go well with heavier flavored fishes- salmon, seabass, red tuna. either again baked or sauteed or grilled.
