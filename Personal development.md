# Personal development

## Goals
Overarching goal (Definite Chief Aim): what do I want out of life and who do I want to be in the process? If we don't know where we want to go, we are being lived and we can easily end up in places of regret. Steer your life to where you want it to go. 

What we need to achieve goals: 
- Fundamental belief you can succeed 
- Want it bad enough - we need a burning desire
- Be determined to succeed and not give up when the going gets hard – I need to be persistant. 

**Goal setting** 
Set goals but break them down and be practical around the goal. 
- What does the end result of the goal look lik? (e.g. learning how to cook: be able to make reciples comfortably)
- What needs to be done to reach that goal? (cook new reciples, not really reading books or watching videos - they're a supplement to actually making recipes)
- What is the simplest first step that puts me in the right direction? Make 1 new recipe this weekend. Finding a recipe takes 10 minutes and it puts me on the path towards the goal. Then I hold myself accountable to these small goals/habits which will ultimately lead to reaching the goal
- Do that first step for 1 hour today and see how that goes. By blocking this time, you know that you will still have time for everything else in life. It's all about balancing different 'priorities' and this avoids obsessiviness  

## Visualization
Reflect on your goals and the person you want to become each morning and evening. Visualize being in possesion of / doing the things you aim for.

Do this often a few minutes a day:
- Visualize yourself having successfully carried out the plan and achieve the goals 
- Visualize performing the corresponding actions that lead towards achieving those goals.  
- The dominating thought should be the a picture of the person you’re trying to build. Spend 30 minutes a day creating a clear mental picture of that person and remind yourself always and think in the shoes of that person
- Ensure there is the self confidence and belief that I can succeed by continuously telling yourself that you’re capable of doing the job. 

**Master Mind**
Each night, envision being sat at a table with people you greatly admire whose traits you’d like to encompass within yourself and then you start speaking to them about what you would like to make your personality. You speak about the challenges your facing and imagine them giving advice - have a discussion with them. 

## How to not overthink
The impact of overthinking: 
- It's hard to switch my mind. 
  - This will impact the relationships in my life as I can't provide full attention and support to friends/family/spouse. 
  - If I'm focused on my own problems during standup, I don't listen anymore to what others say. This would hinder me from being a great manager
- It's the opposite of having a calm mind that is required to be most effective
- It doesn't allow me to focus on the things I should be focused on 
- It is not helping me to make the most of my life

Overthinking makes me unable to focus my mind on anything other than the thing I'm overthinking. Most often, there are a few solutions to overthinking: 
- Talk to the person involved. Be honest about you're feelings and ask them questions. Instead of thinking what their motivations are, ask them as me thinking what they think won't get anywhere 
- The future is largely out of our control once we have done everything we can. Don't focus on things out of our control and bring the focus back to what we can control
- What is the easiest first step to do? Forget about planning the optimal way to do things, take the first step and be fine if things don't go exactly as planned. This type of overthinking is essentially procrastination
- Realize that problems aren't solved by thinking about them. So either action towards them or don't do anything at all. And when you forget about things, the subconscious mind might help coming up with the solution 
- Focus on the bigger picture - if you're working towards the grander goals in life, most small things become irrelevant and there is no need to overthink quite as much

## Doing hard things
- It's important to do hard things that stretch me as they are great opportunities to learn and improve. Seek this challenge continiously. Get critical feedback to improve further
- Think about the bigger picture. Always believe the current strugles are small compared to where you want to go. 
- Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state
- Treat hard things as learning experiences. Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. You approached the experience in a certain way. Then you evaluate how it went and you can be better next time. 
- Have a growth mindset. It's a puzzle to solve which is exciting - it's an opportunity to learn 
- Evaluate how others do it and try to emulate this 
- Prepare well in advance 
- Visualize doing it succesfully in the way you'd idealize it. 
- Go back in time at places where you felt really nervous. Do these things matter now?
- Use affirmations to convince yourself that you can do it 
- Bring it back to the person you want to be and realize that is just another step to getting there. 
- Depending on the situation:
    - Be grateful for the opportunity
    - Realize it needs to be done and there is no other option 
- Realize that it matters now, not in the future
- This too, shall pass. I had many struggles before and it all turned out fine. 
- Think about the situation in the grand scheme of things: 
  - Most things don't matter
  - What is the worst that could happen
- We must learn to trust our creative mechanism to perform good
- If you’re disliking the thought of the dentist, realize it’s a choice you’re making and the choice is to have healthy teeth. The suffering of think about the dentist is not really rational because you;ll go anyway. Similarly, if you decide to do a presentation then that decision is made – why worry after?
- Perform well under pressure by practicing without any pressure. Hit a golf club without a ball. Practice a presentation in front of empty chairs. Go into a sales meeting without intending to sell – just to practice  

On the day of execution: 
- Stay focused on other goals before the moment
- Realize is it okay and natural to be nervous
- Just before presentation: 
    - Find a way to relax – e.g. listen to music beforehand 
    - Power pose in a bathroom and make yourself as big possible 
    - Heavy breathing for a short while

## Relaxation techniques 
Aim to be relaxed at all times. It is impossible to feel anything negative when you are relaxed. 
- Create a relax room in your mind in a lot of detail - the chair you sit in, the smell, the surrounding. Whenever you have a few minutes to spare or whenever you start to feel stress coming up, retrieve into this mental room. In this room, you are secure and there is nothing to worry about, no decisions, no bother, no hurry. Consider all stressful moments and anxiety and just don’t respond and sit in your quiet room. Remember in detail the sensation of relaxation. How did your body feel? You could mentally visualize yourself being relaxed. Tell yourself occasionally: I feel relaxed  
- Lie on the bed and imagine parts of your body being made of concrete, sinking in the mattras
- Remember a pleasant scene of the past and remember it in detail 

## Self-confidence
- Self-confidence is knowing that you can do/handle things. True confidence comes from past experience but you can act confident and it works (fake it until you make it)
- Increase confidence: 
  - Do lots of hard things and both succeed (makes you feel confident) and fail (makes you realize it's not the end of the world) 
  - Become good at something you set your mind to. Accomplishing things you want to accomplish
  - Remember past successes, great things you have done, your strenghts and how great you are. We are often so caught up within ourselves that we forget about all the ways we should be grateful and we’re great. Make this a habit 
  - Visualize success
  - Only engage in positive self talk. Recognize negative automatic thoughts and write it down or think about it - see CBT. 

## Self esteem
Belief and confidence in your value and that you're good enough - just the way you are. Feeling comfortable in own skin and not needing others for validation. 

**How to improve self esteem**
Accepting yourself
- Realize that you have value. That what you want, what you think, what matters to you is as important as it is for anybody else. Just accept me for who I am.
- Remember good memories and practice gratitude 
- It's okay the way it is. Relax. 
- Nobody demands perfection - that's just in my head. I'm not as important as to never be allowed to make mistakes. I do and I will continue to and that's okay. 
- Expose yourself as this non perfect human being 
- Think about what friends would say if I were to present my feelings around this?
