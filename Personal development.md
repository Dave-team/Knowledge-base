# Personal development

## Doing hard things
- It's important to do hard things that stretch me as they are great opportunities to learn and improve. Seek this challenge continiously. Get critical feedback to improve further
- Think about the bigger picture. Always believe the current strugles are small compared to where you want to go. 
- Realize that performance and clarity of thought will be best in a confident and calm state
- Treat hard things as learning experiences. Rather than approaching it with anxiety, think: let’s see what happens. You approached the experience in a certain way. Then you evaluate how it went and you can be better next time 
- Evaluate how others do it and try to emulate this 
- Prepare well in advance 
- Visualize doing it succesfully in the way you'd idealize it. 
- Use affirmations to convince yourself that you can do it 
- Bring it back to the person you want to be and realize that is just another step to getting there. 
- Depending on the situation:
    - Be grateful for the opportunity
    - Realize it needs to be done and there is no other option 
- Realize that it matters now, not in the future
- This too, shall pass. I had many struggles before and it all turned out fine. 
- Think about the situation in the grand scheme of things: 
  - Most things don't matter
  - What is the worst that could happen
- We must learn to trust our creative mechanism to perform good
- If you’re disliking the thought of the dentist, realize it’s a choice you’re making and the choice is to have healthy teeth. The suffering of think about the dentist is not really rational because you;ll go anyway. Similarly, if you decide to do a presentation then that decision is made – why worry after?
- Perform well under pressure by practicing without any pressure. Hit a golf club without a ball. Practice a presentation in front of empty chairs. Go into a sales meeting without intending to sell – just to practice  

On the day of execution: 
- Stay focused on other goals before the moment
- Realize is it okay and natural to be nervous
- Just before presentation: 
    - Find a way to relax – e.g. listen to music beforehand 
    - Power pose in a bathroom and make yourself as big possible 
    - Heavy breathing for a short while

Relaxation techniques 
Aim to be relaxed at all times. It is impossible to feel anything negative when you are relaxed. To that extend, create a relax room in your mind. Imagine this room vividly and in a lot of detail. The colours of the wall, the chair you sit in, the paintings, the smell, the surrounding. Whenever you have a few minutes to spare or whenever you start to feel stress coming up, retrieve into this mental room. In this room, you are secure and there is nothing to worry about, no decisions, no bother, no hurry. ‘When the phone rings, you just let it ring’. Consider all stressful moments and anxiety and just don’t respond and sit in your quiet room. When you have used relaxation techniques well, you should be able to take that feeling to everyday activities. Remember in detail the sensation of relaxation. How did your body feel? You could mentally visualize yourself being relaxed. Tell yourself occasionally: I feel relaxed  
Other techniques: 
- Lie on the bed and imagine parts of your body being made of concrete, sinking in the mattras
- You’re a doll attached with loose strings 
- Your body is filled with balloons and they’re all deflated at the same time 
- Remember a pleasant scene of the past and remember it in small detail 

## Reduce anxiety during meetings
- Be confident and belief in my own performance:
  - My work has high impact and I'm working on the right priorities at the right time. If I feel like I'm not doing the right thing, then I might need to take a step back and refocus to the highest priority work that needs doing.  
  - I have the technical ability and when I don't, I know that I have the ability to pick it up rapidly
  - I have the business understanding and when I don't, I know how to get it by communicating with the right stakeholders. 
  - Know who you are and where you are going and be very confident in that. Whether people agree or not is not your business – you’re doing things your way because you’re on a specific path. What others think is irrelevant and you can’t please everyone 
- Love what you do, be proud of your work and be enthusiastic to communicate around what you're doing. Be interested and interesting to your coworkers and speak at all opportunities - that's what all great speakers do; they want to communicate. Somethings, things don't go as expected or we make mistakes. That's okay. You're still working on the right thing and you know that you will overcome the challenges thrown at you. 
- Become the person you want to eventually be: 
  - So any meeting is me being my best self and it doesn’t matter who I present to. I put my best forward and I’m out of control for anything else. I present my own brand and as part of me being at my best I need to communicate well during meetings and I need to present in public. I wouldn’t to where I want to be without these
  - If I am to become the person I want to be, these meetings are really small. Imagine speaking in interviews as a head of data of Facebook - that's the type of benchmark we're aiming for. People above me will notice when I'm ready to take a jump so I should work on portraying confidence and calm in any situation if I want to achieve what I want. I just have to. 
  - Be a leader: a leader is someone who is in the moment when listening, adds value/support where he can to other points and provides authority, influence and clarity on next steps when presenting. The more confidence you have, the more impact you’ll have. Both for leaders as well as public speakers  
  - Remind yourself that a calm mind would allow me to present with more clarity as I'll be focused on providing value to those in the sessions as opposed to being selfishly stuck in my own mind. In general, once I care a bit less and am much calmer around the situation, my performance will improve
  - Get more used to being uncomfortable which will build your intrinsic confidence. The end goal is to stand above these situations because you're used to being uncomfortable and this is small in the grand scheme of things
  - When things get hard: 
    - Have a growth mindset. It's a puzzle to solve which is exciting - it's an opportunity to learn 
    - I want to live a well lived life which includes overcoming hard challenges. This will add value to me as a person and it will help build my character
- Enjoy life: 
  - Have bigger things going on for you beyond work: have hobbies, work out, work towards achieving goals. 
  - Seperate your value as a person from your what is going on at work. Detach myself from caring about the outcome and I avoid getting invested emotionally in the job. Life is short and we want to perform well at work but we shouldn't take it all too seriously because in the grand scheme of things, it just doesn't matter as much. It's definitely not intended to have a major impact on your mental health. On the shortness of life: 
    - It's a mirable that we're alive in the first place 
    - We're only on this planet for a very short period of time, especially considering the grander scheme of things. 
  - My primiary purpose in life now is happiness. Worrying about work is not adding to this happiness at all. So either fix the issue, communicate about the problem, think about the solution but don't overthink and go around in circles of anxiety. That holds no purpose
  - Be grateful: you like your job and you have a lot of things going well. 
  - Just take it easy
- Understand the purpose
  - The fundamental goal is to bring value to the company and that's what I itend to do consistently
  - When you speak, think not of yourself and how it might be interpreted, think about adding value to the audience. When I believe I don’t add value, my presentation will be bad. Whatever I present, I am completely in it and I will present with enthusiasm so even if nobody cares, I can still make 1 person more curious. And even if that doesn’t help, I will still make it at the very least an endearing presentation and I presented a topic to the best of my ability
  - My ego is telling me that I should be doing certain things and when I don't feel like I meet these things, my ego is getting in the way 
  - Understand the purpose of the session: it's not to evaluate your performance. It's not to understand whether you've performed well and 'passed the test' for the week. It's about each person bringing clarity to what is happening that might also impact them and giving people an opportunity to add context, become aware of things happening and steer where help is required. 
  - There shouldn't be any reason for worry as long as I do my job. And even then, I should be in a strong place to not be depending on whatever job I may hold at any one point in time.  
  - Realise that everyone involved wants me to do well. If they think I don't do well, they will interfere but for now, I'm confident I'm doing the right things
- Let go of anything that is not within control: 
  - Maybe it will go well, maybe it won't. I'd like it if it did, but it's not the end of the world if it doesn't, and it's not even really under my control. So relax, and enjoy it.

- Other tips: 
  - Track the things you're doing during the week 
  - Make it an experiment. I know I need to speak in public and I know I struggle with it. I will feel nerves and there is some imposter syndrome. However, each time I try to prepare, use affirmations and do my very best
  - Speak up early in the meeting - this will remove some of the nerves as there’ll be some engagement already. It’ll show that it’s not as scary as you might think
  - Always keep a confident body language 
  - Become closer and more friendly to the people you are anxious around. The reason you're not anxious around people I'm more familiar with is because they know what I work on and I know they have the context and understanding 
  - Sometimes, things just don't go as planned and unforeseen effort needs to be put in to make something work. We can not do that and things will go bad, so we have to do it. When we plan for projects in advance, there is no sense of understanding how long things will take and we cannot plan for any unforeseen work that comes up - either ad hoc or as part of the work involved in a bigger project. This makes a roadmap by definition unreliable as a timeline and if ad hoc work comes in between, shifts need to be made in the roadmap and in the expectations across the business. 
  - I can work harder when need to, but the effect of that is likely that I'll work in a hurry and mistake will be creeping in. Our job requires a lot of brain power and forcing ourselves beyond what our body/brain is capable of will ultimately lead to mistakes  
  - Break your tasks down into smaller tasks, so you have something new to add every meeting. In the rare case that nothing might be happening, mention it and ask them how you can support them 
  - Threat all these things as experiments: I get to speak in public - let's see how my body and mind will respond 
  - Distract yourself when others are speaking and you're not up yet: take notes, focus on your breath, engage, use a repetitive mantra
  - Perhaps don't prepare word for word what you will say but have the high level topics written out on a piece of paper in advance 
  - Go back in time at places where you felt really nervous. Do these things matter now?

## Overcoming imposter syndrome 
When working on something I am stuck on and I start feeling self-doubt because something is taking longer as it should / is not as good as expected, I likely stress out about how I'm viewed by coworkers and managers. Being aware that we're in the circle is step one - the only way to get out of it is realizing that we're stuck. 
- Remind yourself: 
  - The feature will take as long as it takes me.
  - I work hard and care about the quality of the code I produce.
  - I have asked for help when I’m stuck. If not, I can and should.
  - I have communicated my current status to the stakeholders of my feature.
  - F**k everything else.
- Be kind to yourself. Sometimes you just cant tackle a problem, that’s ok, it doesn’t mean that you’ll never be able to, it just means that you can’t right now. Give yourself some time and don’t let feelings of guilt or shame take over. Take a half an hour walk, or even a whole day or two away from the problem, but schedule in a start time for when you will try again in the future.
- Remember that ‘Perfect is the enemy of great’. Focus on the end goal and do the minimum required to get to the end goal. 
- Acknowledge that you are your own most harsh critic. Most people don’t expect perfection from other people, perfectionists only think that they do. No one is going to judge you as harshly as you judge yourself. It is ok to make mistakes, everyone does! It is ok to release imperfect code. It is even ok if someone calls you up on a mistake you made, thank them, learn from it and you’ll both move on with your lives, the world will not end.
- Try to see yourself as you see your friends. It is easy to start putting yourself down when you don’t meet your own unachievable expectations. Consider how you’d react if someone said the things you’re thinking about yourself about one of your friends.
- Think your fears though to their logical conclusion. Perfectionists often think catastrophically, ‘If i make a mistake in front of my colleagues then that will be the end of everything’, without really thinking through what ‘the end of everything’ would actually look like. Consider the worst possible outcome of your fear, then be honest with yourself about how likely that scenario actually is. Then you can start to consider how such an event would actually play out and how bad or not it would actually be.
- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. The crux of imposter syndrome is that you’re comparing what you know to what you think other people know (similar to seeing people's life on Instagram). You don't see the struggles that other people are or have been going through. And when you realize someone is better in some specific thing, be thankful that you know them as now you can learn from them. Accept that there will never be a point where you’ll feel completely knowledgeable and completely comfortable. Embrace your ignorance and use that to fuel your growth, not your self-doubt.
- Adopt the growth mindset: view obstacles as opportunities to learn, get better and improve rather than proof that you're not good enough. Essentially, your feeling of inadequacy is a signal that you’re being challenged. To really become a great developer, you need to embrace that challenge and actually seek it out. View it as an opportunity to learn, to become better, and to grow.
- Keep track of your accomplishments. Regularly reflecting on your successes can help remind you of how far you’ve come and how good you really are. Write down all accomplishments at the end of a month - whatever learning experiences you had (can also include faillures). More regularly, reflect on past accomplishments and understand how these make you feel. Accept that you have had some role in your successes. We feel like frauds because we are “unable to internalize our successes”. We were given an opportunity that others weren’t. And so nothing we achieve after that opportunity was actually deserved.
- Find out how your manager thinks you’re doing: Imposter syndrome thrives when all you do is think. One of the things you need to do is get out of your own head to combat imposter syndrome. Your manager is the person who has control over your job and getting their input on how you’re doing is essential for getting a realistic view of your skills and effectiveness. Discuss: 
  - What do they feel you’re doing well? Make sure you keep doing this.
  - Is there anything specific they feel you need to work on in the short-term? If so, what measurable goals can you both set to determine success?
  - What longer-term (3-6 months), measurable goals can you both set that will indicate success to your manager? This is useful when you’re just starting with a new company or on a new team to calibrate your progress expectations to theirs’.
- Come off it. Usually I feel like a fraud when I think I’m more important than I am. When you feel like a fraud it’s in relation to some perfection that never actually existed. Letting go of some of your excess self-importance will go a long way in helping you feel less like a fake. Again, come off it, you’re just not that special - expose yourself totally. Part of the twisted arrogance that causes impostor syndrome is the (usually unconscious) belief that you have extreme powers that the world couldn’t handle
- Focus on providing value. I feel like a fraud when I’m concerned about myself. What will they think of me? If I fail they’ll shun me. I don’t know as much as that other guy, I have no right to say anything on the topic. Blah blah blah. The fastest way to get over feeling like a fraud is to genuinely try to help someone else. 
- Keep a file of people saying nice things about you. 
- Acceptance of ourselves and those around us. If you can admit that nobody belongs here more than you (while maintaining the belief that you don’t belong here any more than anyone else) you will find yourself making connections with people in powerful ways.
- Don't take up the defintion of expert - say what you can do. People respect this much more. Admit that you don’t yet have the answer but you’ll find it.
- Realize that nobody knows what they’re doing
- Impostor Syndrome cannot do damage to the person who consistently takes action and knows he's doing the right things. 








## Overcoming anxiety
- Separate yourself from your feelings and emotions. I am not anxiety. An anxious thought is a type of thought that can enter my brain but how I choose to respond to it and perceive it is what is going to define me.
- I’ve found it’s beneficial to learn to recognize the thought and try to just let it pass. “Oh, there went an anxious thought.”… 



## Definite chief aim
First, we need to know what we want out of life and then we need specific plans aimed towards reaching that goal. We need a burning desire for something, that is translated into a definite chief aim and put into action. Include in the definite chief aim a statement of the qualities you intend to develop in yourself. If we don't know where we want to go, we are being lived and we can easily end up in places of regret. Steer your life to where you want it to go. 

## Auto Suggestion / imagination
Put the definite chief aim somewhere where it’s very accessible and reflect on it each night and morning. Repeat the aim to yourself and see yourself in full possession of the object of that aim. It needs to be planted in the subconsius mind. Create a mental picture of what success looks like. 

Do this often a few minutes a day:
- Visualize yourself having successfully carried out the plan and achieve the goals 
- Visualize performing the corresponding actions that lead towards achieving those goals.  
- The dominating thought should be the a picture of the person you’re trying to build. Spend 30 minutes a day creating a clear mental picture of that person and remind yourself always and think in the shoes of that person
- Always have the end goals in mind 
- Ensure there is the self confidence and belief that I can succeed by continuously telling yourself that you’re capable of doing the job. 

## Master Mind
Each night, envision being sat at a table with people you greatly admire whose traits you’d like to encompass within yourself and then you start speaking to them about what you would like to make your personality. You speak about the challenges your facing and imagine them giving advice - have a discussion with them. 

## Self-confidence
- Step aside of yourself and ask yourself what a good friend would tell you
- Usually, when we help out our friends we boost their confidence by confirming all the ways they are actually amazing. The problem is that when we are often so caught up within ourselves that we forget about all the ways we should be grateful and we’re great 
- In my thoughts I feel like X vs you are doing X - we're often not aware except for what we tell ourselves 
- If I was confident, how would my day look like? How would I behave? How would I feel? 
- Self confidence develops when used but disappears if not used 
- Self confidence is built on an experience of success. Constantly remember past successes and forget failures  
- -	Get in the winning feeling by remembering successes and by visualizing your success 

To achieve the aim
1. Belief you can succeed and demand persistent and continuous action towards achievement of the definite purpose
- Want it bad enough 
- Be determined to succeed and not give up when the going gets hard – I need to be persistant. 

General
- Your self image is dependent on the beliefs on yourself. Your self image determines your personality and your behaviour. Improving self image is done through positive imagination 
- Self esteem is about holding a high opinion of myself
