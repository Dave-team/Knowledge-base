# Personal development

## Goals
Overarching goal (Definite Chief Aim): what do I want out of life and who do I want to be in the process? If we don't know where we want to go, we are being lived and we can easily end up in places of regret. Steer your life to where you want it to go. 

What we need to achieve goals: 
- Fundamental belief you can succeed and have the confidence to figure things out as and when they before relevant
- Want it bad enough - we need a burning desire
- Be determined to succeed and not give up when the going gets hard – I need to be persistant. 

## Goals definition
- Clearly defined. Don't say: "I want to have a better life." Be concrete. For example: "I want a new Volvo."
- Focused on results.
- Realistic and logical - what can and can't be achieved? Low goals may produce low performance and unrealistic goals may cause people to cheat. Lucius Annaeus Seneca said we should: "Never work either for useless goals, or impossible ones."
- Measurable.
- Tailored to our individual needs.
- Subject to change. Ask: Given our current objective, what is the best course of action to take?
- Goals also need target dates and control stations measuring the degree to which the goal is being achieved. Do we know what causes our goal to be achieved? We can't achieve what we want if we don't understand what makes it happen. And are we sure our goal is the right one for what we finally want to achieve?

**Goal setting** 
Set goals but break them down and be practical around the goal. 
- What does the end result of the goal look lik? (e.g. learning how to cook: be able to make reciples comfortably)
- What needs to be done to reach that goal? (cook new reciples, not really reading books or watching videos - they're a supplement to actually making recipes)
- What is the simplest first step that puts me in the right direction? Make 1 new recipe this weekend. Finding a recipe takes 10 minutes and it puts me on the path towards the goal. Then I hold myself accountable to these small goals/habits which will ultimately lead to reaching the goal. - What is the easiest first step to do? Forget about planning the optimal way to do things, take the first step and be fine if things don't go exactly as planned. This type of overthinking is essentially procrastination
- Do that first step for 1 hour today and see how that goes. By blocking this time, you know that you will still have time for everything else in life. It's all about balancing different 'priorities' and this avoids obsessiviness. Take things step by step and don’t try to do everything at once.  I can think about what I want to do, I can spend some time trying a hobby for 30 minutes a day and build on top of that. And make sure to do this method rather than overthinking what the best hobby is that I can spend all my time with. Things don’t need to happen from today onto tomorrow. Take your time. 

**Goal achievement** 
It is essential that you approach this process in a clearheaded, rational way, looking down on yourself from yourself and by being ruthlessly honest. If your emotions are getting the better of you, step back and take time out until you can reflect clearly. Seek help from calm, thoughtful people when necessary. 

- Have clear goals – what are you going after? Design a plan to achieve these goals
- Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 
- Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. Be calm and analytical
- Design plans that will get around them
- Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results. Consistency and determination are key. 

## Visualization
Reflect on your goals and the person you want to become each morning and evening. Visualize being in possesion of / doing the things you aim for. See things from the eyes of other great and smart people

Do this often a few minutes a day:
- Visualize yourself having successfully carried out the plan and achieve the goals 
- Visualize performing the corresponding actions that lead towards achieving those goals.  
- The dominating thought should be the a picture of the person you’re trying to build. Spend 30 minutes a day creating a clear mental picture of that person and remind yourself always and think in the shoes of that person
- Ensure there is the self confidence and belief that I can succeed by continuously telling yourself that you’re capable of doing the job. 

A good way to visualize picking up / breaking habits: 
- List all the benefits from doing something you want to do (e.g. quit smoking)
- Visualize yourself going about doing something you want that involves the benefits of what you want to do 
- Now fantasize yourself in that same moment without e.g. the bad habit that you developed and with al the advantages that come with it 

**Master Mind**
Each night, envision being sat at a table with people you greatly admire whose traits you’d like to encompass within yourself and then you start speaking to them about what you would like to make your personality. You speak about the challenges your facing and imagine them giving advice - have a discussion with them. 

## Affirmations
- Use affirmations to convince yourself that you can do it. A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it's personal, it's positive, it's present tense, it's visual, and it's emotional. The benefit of affirmations is that they go into the subconscious mind. 

## Relaxation techniques 
Aim to be relaxed at all times. It is impossible to feel anything negative when you are relaxed. 
- Create a relax room in your mind in a lot of detail - the chair you sit in, the smell, the surrounding. Whenever you have a few minutes to spare or whenever you start to feel stress coming up, retrieve into this mental room. In this room, you are secure and there is nothing to worry about, no decisions, no bother, no hurry. Consider all stressful moments and anxiety and just don’t respond and sit in your quiet room. Remember in detail the sensation of relaxation. How did your body feel? You could mentally visualize yourself being relaxed. Tell yourself occasionally: I feel relaxed  
- Lie on the bed and imagine parts of your body being made of concrete, sinking in the mattras
- Remember a pleasant scene of the past and remember it in detail 

## Self-confidence
- Self-confidence is knowing that you can do/handle things. True confidence comes from past experience but you can act confident and it works (fake it until you make it)
- Increase confidence: 
  - Do lots of hard things and both succeed (makes you feel confident) and fail (makes you realize it's not the end of the world) 
  - Become good at something you set your mind to. Accomplishing things you want to accomplish
  - Remember past successes, great things you have done, your strenghts and how great you are. We are often so caught up within ourselves that we forget about all the ways we should be grateful and we’re great. Make this a habit 
  - Visualize success
  - Only engage in positive self talk. Recognize negative automatic thoughts and write it down or think about it - see CBT. 

## Self esteem
Belief and confidence in your value and that you're good enough - just the way you are. Feeling comfortable in own skin and not needing others for validation. 

**How to improve self esteem**
Accepting yourself
- Realize that you have value. That what you want, what you think, what matters to you is as important as it is for anybody else. Just accept me for who I am.
- Remember good memories and practice gratitude 
- It's okay the way it is. Relax. 
- Nobody demands perfection - that's just in my head. I'm not as important as to never be allowed to make mistakes. I do and I will continue to and that's okay. 
- Expose yourself as this non perfect human being 
- Think about what friends would say if I were to present my feelings around this? 
- It’s okay. All will be well. I’ve got this
- You don’t have to do anything especially worthy to create or deserve self-esteem; all you have to do is turn off that critical, haranguing, inner voice. 

CBT way of building self esteem: 
- Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind;
- Learn why these thoughts are distorted; and
- Practice talking back to them so as to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system”

## Other
- Rather than trying to fix myself holistically, move into a state where you specifically work on fixing some problems. It’s hard work and consuming content will not help solving the questions
- To be honest, speak without identity and let go of the ego.
